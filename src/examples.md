# Example Scenarios

← [Back to Introduction](./introduction.md)

These scenarios show the framework in action. Names are fictional. Situations are composites based on real dynamics.

## Scenario 1: The Accidental Touch

### What Happened

During a cuddle party, **Alex** is lying next to **Jordan**. They've agreed to side-by-side cuddling, nothing more.

Alex shifts position and their hand lands on Jordan's thigh—higher than intended. Jordan tenses. Alex doesn't notice for a few seconds, then realizes and pulls back.

"Oh god, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to—"

Jordan says "It's fine" but looks uncomfortable. They get up and move to another part of the room.

### Applying the Framework

**What's the severity?**

- No lasting harm
- Jordan was uncomfortable but not injured
- Recoverable

→ **LOW to MEDIUM**

**What's the type?**

- Alex wasn't thinking—they shifted in their sleep-adjacent state
- No malicious intent
- Classic [popcorn situation](./tools/popcorn-metaphor.md)

→ **ACCIDENT (unconscious)**

**What's the appropriate response?**

Alex already apologized. Jordan removed themselves from the situation.

An appropriate response:

- Alex checks in later: "Hey, I want to make sure you're okay. I'm sorry about earlier."
- Jordan can accept, ask for space, or share how it affected them
- Facilitators don't need to intervene unless Jordan asks

An **inappropriate** response:

- Jordan tells others Alex "groped" them
- Others treat Alex like a predator
- Alex gets banned from future events

That would be an over-response—treating a LOW/MEDIUM accident like HIGH severity malice.

**Repair:**

Alex offered an apology. If Jordan wants more:

- A conversation about what happened
- Alex acknowledging the impact
- Agreement about boundaries going forward

If Jordan doesn't want contact, Alex respects that. Respecting the boundary IS the repair.

## Scenario 2: The Fawning Dynamic

### What Happened

At a tantra workshop, **Marcus** asks **Elena** if she'd like to do a breathwork exercise together that involves some chest contact.

Elena feels put on the spot. Marcus is enthusiastic, others are pairing up, and she doesn't want to seem uptight. She says yes.

During the exercise, Elena dissociates. She goes through the motions but isn't present. Afterward, she feels violated—even though she said yes.

A week later, Elena tells the facilitator that Marcus "didn't get real consent."

### Applying the Framework

This is a [fawning](./concepts/fawning.md) situation. **There are two victims.**

**Elena is victimized by:**

- Her own trauma response (fawning)
- An experience she didn't actually want
- The aftermath of dissociation

**Marcus is victimized by:**

- False information (he thought consent was real)
- Being labeled as someone who violated consent
- Loss of ability to act with integrity—he didn't know

**What's the severity?**

For Elena: MEDIUM (temporary harm, recoverable but real)
For Marcus: Potentially HIGH if his reputation is damaged

**What's the type?**

This isn't malice. This isn't even a typical accident.

This is **fawning**—a trauma response that creates harm for both parties.

**Responsibility:**

| Person | Responsibility                                                                   |
| ------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Marcus | Could have checked in more, read cues, created space for a real "no"             |
| Elena  | Owns that she said yes when she meant no; doesn't blame Marcus for believing her |

**Appropriate response:**

The facilitator should:

1. Talk to both people separately
2. Recognize this as fawning, not violation
3. Help Elena understand her trauma response
4. Not treat Marcus as a perpetrator
5. Facilitate a conversation if both are willing

**Inappropriate response:**

- Facilitator takes Elena's framing at face value
- Marcus is banned or publicly shamed
- Elena never examines her own fawning pattern

This would create more harm than the original incident.

**Repair:**

Elena acknowledges: "I said yes, but I wasn't being honest. That's on me. I also wish you'd checked in more."

Marcus acknowledges: "I'm sorry you had that experience. I'll be more attentive to cues going forward."

Both learn. Neither is the villain.

## Scenario 3: The Witch Hunt

### What Happened

At a play party, **Sam** and **Taylor** have a conflict. The details are murky—something about a boundary that may or may not have been crossed.

Taylor is furious. They tell multiple people that Sam "violated" them. They're visibly upset, crying, shaking.

Bystanders see Taylor's distress. They see Sam looking guilty and apologizing (Sam is [fawning](./concepts/fawning.md) out of fear, not admitting fault).

Nobody asks Sam what happened. Nobody talks to the one witness who saw the interaction. People just see:

- Upset person = victim
- Apologizing person = guilty

By the end of the night, a group has decided Sam is a predator. Word spreads. Sam is disinvited from future events.

### Applying the Framework

**Before judging: Is anyone qualified?**

Let's check using the [Before You Judge](./concepts/before-you-judge.md) framework:

| Question                                 | The Bystanders                    |
| ---------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Did they witness it?                     | No                                |
| Did they talk to both people?            | No, only Taylor                   |
| Did they verify with the actual witness? | No                                |
| Is their source biased?                  | Yes—Taylor is activated and angry |

→ **Nobody is qualified to judge.**

**What actually happened?**

We don't know—and that's the point. The bystanders don't know either. They **assumed** based on:

- Who was louder
- Who was crying
- Who was apologizing

None of that is evidence.

**The over-response:**

Even if Sam did something wrong:

- What was the severity? Unknown.
- What was the type? Unknown.
- Is banning proportional? Unknown.

The bystanders responded with **HIGH severity consequences** to an incident of **unknown severity and type**.

If Sam's mistake was actually LOW or MEDIUM, the response itself became the greater harm.

> "If you cry victim hard enough, you become the perpetrator."

**What should have happened:**

1. Facilitators intervene, separate the parties
2. Facilitators talk to Sam, Taylor, and the witness separately
3. Facilitators assess severity and type based on primary sources
4. Response matches what actually happened
5. No mob judgment based on vibes

**The fawning trap:**

Sam apologized because Taylor felt like a threat—someone who could rally others against them. Sam didn't agree they did something wrong. They were trying to survive.

Bystanders read the apology as confession. It wasn't.

## Key Takeaways

| Scenario         | Core Lesson                                                                                      |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Accidental Touch | Accidents happen. Response should match severity, not emotional volume.                          |
| Fawning Dynamic  | "Yes" doesn't always mean yes. Both parties are victims. Both have responsibility.               |
| Witch Hunt       | You're not qualified to judge if you haven't verified. Acting anyway makes YOU a source of harm. |
