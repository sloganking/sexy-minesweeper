## Why This Exists

You're about to enter—or you're already in—spaces where people explore intimacy, touch, sexuality, and somatic practices.

These spaces are beautiful. They can also be messy.

People make mistakes. Boundaries get crossed. Feelings get hurt. And because our culture carries so much trauma around sexuality, these mistakes often get handled badly—with shame, witch hunts, or silence.

**This guide exists to help you navigate that mess with more clarity and less harm.**

It's not about being perfect. It's about knowing what to do when things aren't.

## Who This Is For

- **Participants** in play parties, cuddle events, tantra workshops, sacred sexuality temples, somatic experiencing groups, or any space where bodies and boundaries intersect
- **Facilitators** who hold these spaces and need to respond when things go wrong
- **Anyone** who wants to think more clearly about mistakes, responsibility, and repair

---

## What You'll Learn

This framework gives you tools to:

1. **Assess what happened** — Was it a mistake or malice? How serious was it?
2. **Respond appropriately** — Not too much, not too little
3. **Repair harm** — When possible, and how
4. **Recognize distortions** — Trauma, bias, and mob dynamics that cloud judgment
5. **Take responsibility** — Without shame, with power

---

## A Note on Tone

This guide will challenge some things you might believe.

It will say that victims have responsibility too. That power dynamics go both ways. That crying victim loud enough can make you the perpetrator. That your trauma doesn't excuse harming others.

**This is not victim-blaming.**

It's about empowerment. Seeing your power. Recognizing that you're not helpless, even when bad things happen. That clarity and fairness serve everyone better than mob justice and shame spirals.

If that lands wrong at first, sit with it. The concepts build on each other.

## How to Read This

### If you're new to these spaces:

Start here:

1. [Severity](./concepts/severity.md) — The scale of harm
2. [Types of Mistakes](./concepts/types-of-mistakes.md) — Not all mistakes are the same
3. [The Popcorn Metaphor](./tools/popcorn-metaphor.md) — A gentle way to understand accidents
4. [Fawning](./concepts/fawning.md) — When "yes" means "no"
5. [Responsibility](./concepts/responsibility.md) — What it actually means
6. [Appropriate Response](./concepts/appropriate-response.md) — Matching your reaction to reality

Then explore the rest as needed.

### If something just happened:

Go straight to:

1. [Response Flowchart](./charts/response-flowchart.md) — Step-by-step what to do
2. [Before You Judge](./concepts/before-you-judge.md) — Make sure you're qualified to respond
3. [Making It Right](./concepts/making-it-right.md) — How repair works

### If you're a facilitator:

Read everything, then focus on:

1. [Appropriate Response](./concepts/appropriate-response.md)
2. [Before You Judge](./concepts/before-you-judge.md)
3. [Power Dynamics](./concepts/power-dynamics.md)
4. Facilitator Protocols _(coming soon)_

## The Core Principle

When something goes wrong, ask:

> **What is the severity? What is the type? Am I qualified to judge? Is my response proportional?**

That's it. Everything else is detail.
