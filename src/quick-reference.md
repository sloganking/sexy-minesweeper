## Quick Steps

```
WHEN A MISTAKE HAPPENS:
1. Pause, breathe
2. Assess SEVERITY → High / Medium / Low
3. Assess TYPE → Malicious? Accident? Fawning?
4. Check: Am I QUALIFIED to judge? (Before You Judge)
5. Match RESPONSE to severity
6. Focus on REPAIR, not punishment
```

## The Core Principle

> **What is the severity? What is the type? Am I qualified to judge? Is my response proportional?**
