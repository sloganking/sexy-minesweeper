# Severity

← [Back to Introduction](../introduction.md)

How serious is the harm caused? This determines how serious the response should be.

## The Scale

| Level      | Description                                                             | Examples                                         |
| ---------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| **HIGH**   | Permanent harm. Physical or non-physical (reputation, options, safety). | Injury, public shaming, blacklisting             |
| **MEDIUM** | Temporary pain. Recoverable.                                            | Unwanted touch, emotional hurt, boundary crossed |
| **LOW**    | Inconvenience. No one really hurt.                                      | Awkwardness, miscommunication, minor discomfort  |

## Key Principle

**Your response should match the severity level.**

- Responding to LOW with HIGH = you become a source of harm
- Responding to HIGH with LOW = you enable continued harm

See: [Appropriate Response](./appropriate-response.md)
