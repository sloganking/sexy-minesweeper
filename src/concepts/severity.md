# Severity

← [Back to Introduction](../introduction.md)

Most conflicts in these spaces aren't about what happened. They're about disagreements over how serious it was.

**Severity is the foundation.** Get it right, and everything else follows. Get it wrong, and you either enable harm or become the source of it.

## The Scale

| Level      | Description                                                             | Examples                                         |
| ---------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| **HIGH**   | Permanent harm. Physical or non-physical (reputation, options, safety). | Injury, public shaming, blacklisting             |
| **MEDIUM** | Temporary pain. Recoverable.                                            | Unwanted touch, emotional hurt, boundary crossed |
| **LOW**    | Inconvenience. No one really hurt.                                      | Awkwardness, miscommunication, minor discomfort  |

## Your Response Has a Severity

Here's what most people miss:

**Your reaction to harm is itself an action—with its own severity level.**

Someone crosses your boundary. That's their action. You respond. That's YOUR action. And your action can be LOW, MEDIUM, or HIGH severity—independent of what they did.

| They Did | You Did | Result |
| -------- | ------- | ------ |
| LOW harm | LOW response | Proportional. Good. |
| MEDIUM harm | MEDIUM response | Proportional. Good. |
| HIGH harm | HIGH response | Proportional. Justified. |
| LOW harm | HIGH response | **You caused more harm than they did.** |

That last row is where people destroy themselves and others.

Someone makes an awkward comment (LOW). You publicly shame them as a predator (HIGH). Now you've done more damage than they ever did. You've caused permanent harm in response to a recoverable inconvenience.

> **If you cry victim loud enough, you become the perpetrator.**

This is the core insight of the entire book. Your response doesn't just *match* severity—it *has* severity. If your response is higher than the original harm, you're not a victim seeking justice. You're a source of harm.

## Key Principle

**Your response should match the severity level.**

- Responding to LOW with HIGH = you become a source of harm
- Responding to HIGH with LOW = you enable continued harm

See: [Appropriate Response](./appropriate-response.md)

## Feelings Don't Determine Severity

Your feelings are real. They're valid. They matter.

**They don't determine objective severity.**

You can feel HIGH severity distress from a LOW severity event. That's not proof the event was HIGH—it's information about your [filters](./trauma-and-filters.md). Your nervous system might be screaming "DANGER" while the actual harm was... an awkward comment.

This doesn't mean your pain isn't real. It means your pain is not evidence of what actually happened.

When assessing severity, ask:

- What was the **actual harm**? (Not how you feel, but what happened)
- Is it **permanent** or **recoverable**?
- Would a neutral observer, with all the facts, call this HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW?

Your feelings tell you something important—about yourself. They don't tell you how serious the other person's action was. Those are different questions.

## Patterns Change Severity

One exception to the scale: **repetition**.

A single LOW severity mistake is LOW. The same mistake made repeatedly—after being told—becomes higher severity. It's no longer an accident; it's a pattern.

- Someone touches your shoulder once without asking → LOW (awkward, forgivable)
- The same person keeps doing it after you've said stop → MEDIUM or HIGH (pattern of disregard)

Why? Because intent shifts. A one-time mistake can be unconscious. A repeated mistake after clear feedback demonstrates something about the person—they either don't care, or they can't control themselves. Either way, the severity increases.

**Important:** This applies to patterns YOU'VE directly witnessed in YOUR interactions with this person. It does not apply to things you've heard about them. Treating someone's current action as higher severity because of rumors or reputation is exactly what [Before You Judge](./before-you-judge.md) warns against.

## The Severity Shift

In normal everyday life, most of your interactions are **LOW severity**:

- Conversations with coworkers
- Shopping at the grocery store
- Texting friends
- Walking down the street

There are exceptions (driving a car, handling power tools), but moment-to-moment, you're operating in a world where mistakes have minor consequences.

**When you enter a temple or play space, you cross into MEDIUM severity.**

This shift should be consciously acknowledged—by you, and ideally by facilitators welcoming participants. You're entering a zone where:

- Touch is happening
- Boundaries are being negotiated in real-time
- Emotions are heightened
- Mistakes have real consequences

### Why This Matters

This severity shift explains why drama, misinterpretations, and over-responses are more common in these spaces. It's not that the people are more dramatic—it's that everyone is operating at a higher baseline severity than they're used to in daily life.

When you're used to LOW, and suddenly you're in MEDIUM:

- Small mistakes feel bigger
- Stakes feel higher
- [Filters](./trauma-and-filters.md) activate more easily
- The [drama triangle](./drama-triangle.md) becomes more tempting

**Recognizing this shift is part of [taking responsibility](./responsibility.md).** You're not at the grocery store anymore. Act accordingly.

### For Facilitators

Consider explicitly naming this transition when welcoming participants:

> "You're entering a space where the severity level is higher than your everyday life. Touch, intimacy, and emotional vulnerability are all in play. Please be more careful, more present, and more communicative than you would be at a coffee shop."

This sets the tone and reminds everyone to bring their best selves.
