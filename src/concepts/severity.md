# Severity

How serious is the harm caused? This determines how serious the response should be.

## The Scale

| Level      | Description                                                             | Examples                                         |
| ---------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| **HIGH**   | Permanent harm. Physical or non-physical (reputation, options, safety). | Injury, public shaming, blacklisting             |
| **MEDIUM** | Temporary pain. Recoverable.                                            | Unwanted touch, emotional hurt, boundary crossed |
| **LOW**    | Inconvenience. No one really hurt.                                      | Awkwardness, miscommunication, minor discomfort  |

## Key Principle

**Your response should match the severity level.**

- Responding to LOW with HIGH = you become a source of harm
- Responding to HIGH with LOW = you enable continued harm

See: [Appropriate Response](./appropriate-response.md)

## The Severity Shift

In normal everyday life, most of your interactions are **LOW severity**:

- Conversations with coworkers
- Shopping at the grocery store
- Texting friends
- Walking down the street

There are exceptions (driving a car, handling power tools), but moment-to-moment, you're operating in a world where mistakes have minor consequences.

**When you enter a temple or play space, you cross into MEDIUM severity.**

This shift should be consciously acknowledged—by you, and ideally by facilitators welcoming participants. You're entering a zone where:

- Touch is happening
- Boundaries are being negotiated in real-time
- Emotions are heightened
- Mistakes have real consequences

### Why This Matters

This severity shift explains why drama, misinterpretations, and over-responses are more common in these spaces. It's not that the people are more dramatic—it's that everyone is operating at a higher baseline severity than they're used to in daily life.

When you're used to LOW, and suddenly you're in MEDIUM:

- Small mistakes feel bigger
- Stakes feel higher
- [Filters](./trauma-and-filters.md) activate more easily
- The [drama triangle](./drama-triangle.md) becomes more tempting

**Recognizing this shift is part of [taking responsibility](./responsibility.md).** You're not at the grocery store anymore. Act accordingly.

### For Facilitators

Consider explicitly naming this transition when welcoming participants:

> "You're entering a space where the severity level is higher than your everyday life. Touch, intimacy, and emotional vulnerability are all in play. Please be more careful, more present, and more communicative than you would be at a coffee shop."

This sets the tone and reminds everyone to bring their best selves.
