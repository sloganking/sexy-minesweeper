# Making It Right

## The Goal

When a mistake occurs, the goal is **repair**, not punishment.

Rather than blaming, attacking, or going for an eye for an eye—if the person who made a mistake wants to make up for it, **allow them to make it right.**

## Repair Requires Safe Conditions

Before we talk about how to repair, an important clarification:

**[Repair is not the same as responsibility](./responsibility.md#responsibility--repair).**

Responsibility is always yours to take—looking at your part, learning, doing differently next time. That's internal and unconditional.

But repair—restoring the relationship, making amends—is conditional. It requires:

1. **Safety** — You're not being attacked, threatened, or publicly shamed
2. **Good faith** — The other person wants resolution, not punishment
3. **Proportionality** — What's being asked matches the actual harm

If someone is screaming at you, making threats, or demanding you "take responsibility" while attacking you—that's not a repair conversation. That's an attack. And you don't owe repair to someone who is attacking you.

**Contain first. Repair after.**

Everything below assumes the conditions for repair are present. If they're not, see [Decline False Responsibility](./decline-false-responsibility.md).

## How to Make It Right

This isn't a moral instruction. I'm not telling you "you did wrong, now you must suffer through repair."

This is an invitation: **here's how to actually feel good about yourself after you fucked up.**

You made a mistake. You don't feel great about it. So—is there something you can do right now that will leave you feeling *better* about yourself and your value than before this happened?

The answer is yes. And the answer is: add so much value that you're more connected with the person afterward. Make things better than they were *before* the accident occurred.

That's the whole message. Not obligation. Not punishment. Just: here's what works.

### Show, Don't Tell

1. **Take responsibility and ownership** of what occurred
2. **Apologize with action**, not just words

"I'm sorry" is not enough if it leaves the other person still hurt.

Making it right means:

- Asking what they need
- Taking concrete steps
- Following through

### Create More Value Than Was Taken

Here's the gold standard for repair:

**Don't just restore what was lost. Create MORE value than was taken.**

When you make a mistake that hurt someone, you can apologize in a way that blows them out of the water. Go above and beyond. Make the repair so generous, so thoughtful, so clearly from a place of care, that their new reference frame for dealing with you becomes:

> "Even when unwanted mistakes happen with this person, I WIN."

Maybe they got something pleasurable out of it. Maybe they experienced a level of care they rarely receive. Maybe they saw that you take responsibility so thoroughly that they feel safer with you than before the mistake happened.

This is powerful. Most people don't do this. Most people give the minimum apology and hope it's enough. When you consistently add more value than you take—even in repair situations—you become someone people want in their lives.

### Don't Fawn When You Repair

Here's something important: **making it right should not violate your own boundaries.**

You might feel grief or remorse after making a mistake. That's natural. But repair is not self-punishment. You don't owe them actions that make you uncomfortable. You're not doing this out of obligation or blame.

The goal is to add value to them—not to take value from yourself. This isn't eye-for-an-eye. You're not trying to suffer proportionally to what they experienced.

If your repair actions are slightly uncomfortable, that might feel appropriate—your mistake caused them discomfort, so some discomfort in fixing it makes sense. But it doesn't *have* to be uncomfortable. The best repairs come from genuine care, not from guilt-driven self-sacrifice.

**Here's the trap:** If you [fawn](./fawning.md) when you repair—if you appease them by doing things you actually don't want to do—two things happen:

1. **You'll feel resentment.** You did something you didn't want to do. That breeds bitterness, not resolution.
2. **The repair won't actually work.** They might sense you're not genuine. Or you'll pull away later because of the resentment. Either way, it doesn't hold.

Real repair should make you like yourself more, not less. You're becoming someone who takes responsibility AND maintains their own integrity. Both matter.

If what they're asking for crosses your boundaries, you can say:

> "I want to make this right. I'm not available for [X], but I can offer [Y]. Would that work?"

That's still repair. It's just repair that doesn't require self-betrayal.

## When the Other Person Doesn't Want Contact

Sometimes the person receiving the repair may:

- Not want communication at all
- Want less than you want to give
- Need space more than words

**Respecting their wishes IS the action.**

Even if it doesn't feel satisfying because you wanted to give more—honoring their boundary is the repair.

### If You Can't Pay It Back, Pay It Forward

When direct repair isn't available—they don't want contact, or the harm can't be undone—channel that energy forward instead.

- Use what you learned to prevent this harm for others
- Teach what you now know
- Become someone who creates more good than the harm you caused

That's how you make it right when you can't make it right directly. The debt doesn't disappear—but it can be paid to the world instead of the person.

## Allowing Repair

If you're the one who was harmed:

- Can you allow the person to make it right?
- Or are you more invested in punishment?
- What would actually help you heal?

Sometimes people want revenge more than repair. That's a choice—but it's not resolution.

## Real Repair Is Mutual

[Everyone has responsibility](./responsibility.md#omniresponsible) in every situation. Even if someone clearly made a mistake, the other person can still look in the [responsibility mirror](./responsibility.md#the-responsibility-mirror)—not to excuse what happened, but because that's what responsibility looks like.

That said, sometimes one person clearly made the bigger mistake, the other person responds proportionally and allows repair, and one-sided amends works fine. No problem.

**Here's when it becomes a problem:**

Someone responds to a medium-severity harm with a high-severity attack. They play victim. They refuse to own any part—not even a small one. They extract everything—apologies, amends, emotional labor—while contributing nothing.

**This isn't repair. It's one-sided extraction.**

What happens:

- You feel resentment, not resolution
- The relationship doesn't actually heal
- If their response was also harmful (which it often is—over-responses cause real harm), they're getting away with it while you do all the work

This doesn't mean repair has to be perfectly symmetrical. But if one person is doing *all* the owning and the other is doing *all* the blaming—with zero acknowledgment of their part—the repair won't hold.

Real repair looks like both people asking: "What was my part?" Even if the answer is "my part was smaller," the question still matters.

If you're receiving repair and you're not asking that question, you're not participating in repair. You're collecting an apology while staying in Victim.

## When Repair Isn't Possible

Some harms are too severe. Some people won't take [responsibility](./responsibility.md).

In those cases:

- Match [response to severity](./appropriate-response.md)
- Involve facilitators
- Prioritize your safety
- Don't become a harm-creator yourself
