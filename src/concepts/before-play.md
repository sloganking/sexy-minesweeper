## Prevention Is the Happy Path

Most of what this book covers is what to do when things go wrong. But the best way to handle mistakes is to prevent them.

Before engaging in play, intimacy, or sex with someone, have a conversation. Not just "do you consent?"—a real conversation that covers the things that, if you don't discuss them, often turn into the mistakes this book is about.

---

## What Is a "Good Thing"?

Let's define what we're trying to create:

> **A "good thing" is an experience where each participant feels good—both during the interaction and afterward—about what happened.**

That's the goal. Not just pleasure in the moment—but something you both feel good about afterward.

The opposite is an hour of sexual pleasure followed by three months of emotional hell. That's not a good thing, even if it felt good in the moment.

RBDSMT exists to make sure what you're creating is a good thing, not a bad thing.

## RBDSMT: The Safer Sex Conversation

This framework comes from ISTA (International School of Temple Arts), with additions. It stands for:

- **R** — Relationships
- **B** — Boundaries
- **D** — Desires
- **S** — Sexual Health
- **M** — Meaning and Mistakes
- **T** — Trauma

Before playing with someone—especially someone new—talk through each of these. It takes 10-20 minutes. It can save hours of pain, confusion, and repair.

## R — Relationships

**What to discuss:** What are your current relationship structures? Who else is involved? What agreements do you have with others?

**Why it matters:** Playing with someone who has a partner you don't know about, or violating agreements they have with someone else, can create HIGH severity harm—not just to them, but to third parties.

### Examples of What Can Go Wrong

- They're monogamous with a partner at home. You don't know. Their partner finds out, the relationship ends, and suddenly the partner is playing [victim](./drama-triangle.md) and coming after YOU—trying to cause you harm for "destroying their relationship."

- You're at a festival. You've been flirting with someone. They see you kiss someone else. They're polyamorous and know you are too—but they feel jealous. If you have sex with this person, the other one might judge you, act weird toward you, or create drama. Maybe you're okay with that, but you should know about it upfront.

- They have a partner who's at the same event. You don't know. You make a mistake during play—something minor, an accident. The person you're playing with is reasonable and handles it well. But their partner finds out, freaks out, and [witch hunts](./before-you-judge.md) you with HIGH severity. You didn't even know that was a possibility because you didn't know who was partnered with whom.

### The Couples Warning

**Couples are double the risk.**

If you play with someone who has an active romantic partner, you don't just need THEM to be reasonable about mistakes. You need their partner to be reasonable too.

Maybe the person you're playing with assumes the best about mistakes—but their partner does not. Maybe the person you're playing with would handle an accident with grace—but their partner would attack you with HIGH severity.

Before playing with anyone with significant intimacy, figure out:

- Do they have a partner?
- Is that partner here?
- If yes, get to know the partner. Figure out what they're comfortable with. Assess how THEY handle mistakes.

If you're playing with someone who has a partner and you didn't know, you may be in for a surprise when a mistake occurs and suddenly you're dealing with someone you've never met who's explosively angry.

### Assessing Couple Stability

Not all couples are equally safe to play with. Ask yourself—and ask THEM:

- **Are they emotionally stable?** Have you seen them fighting in the container? What were those disagreements about?
- **Have they been non-monogamous for a while?** Or have they been monogamous their whole lives and this is completely new? Someone with years of non-monogamy experience handles things differently than someone trying it for the first time.
- **Do they have precedent?** If they've played with others before and it went well, they have a track record. If this is new territory, there's higher risk of jealousy, upset, or unexpected reactions.
- **Is one of them more ready than the other?** Sometimes one partner says they're good with it, but they're not really. Or one partner pressured the other into "being open."

**Ask explicitly:** "Have you been open and playing with others for a while? Or is non-monogamy new to you?"

### The Mismatched Couple

Watch out for this dynamic:

One partner wants to be monogamous. They don't really want to be at this retreat. They're only here because they're afraid of losing their partner—who IS excited about non-monogamy.

The enthusiastic partner is eager to explore. But they may not actually be "open" in practice, because their reluctant partner is stressed, jealous, or on the verge of a meltdown.

This is a relationship under significant stress. That doesn't mean you CAN'T play with them—it just takes a lot of care.

### If You Choose to Engage

Playing with someone in a mismatched couple is possible. But consider:

- **The level of play should probably be lower.** Not sex. Lesser intimacy. Something that won't create massive waves.
- **Communicate with BOTH partners.** If you're playing with the one who wants non-monogamy, be in deep communication with the one who wants monogamy. What are they actually comfortable with? What would hurt them?
- **Only play in ways that make everyone happy.** The goal is a [good thing](#what-is-a-good-thing)—where everyone feels good during AND after. Including the partner who's not directly involved.
- **They're responsible for their relationship.** You're not responsible for their dynamic. But you might not want to be the person who's there when it all falls apart.

### Personal Considerations

Ask yourself honestly:

- Do I want to be tied up in this drama?
- If their relationship has stress because of what we did, do I want that on my conscience—even if they're ultimately responsible for their own choices?
- Do I like BOTH of them as people? If he's hurting because of what I did with her, will I hurt too?
- Even if it's "not my fault," will I feel good about this afterward?

Maybe the enthusiastic partner would find someone to play with regardless. Maybe their relationship would reach this point anyway. But you get to decide whether you're the person in that story.

Some people are fine with it. Others want to stay clear of the drama entirely. Know yourself.

Once you recognize the situation, ask yourself: Am I comfortable engaging with someone in this relationship state? And at what level of intimacy?

### A Note on Couples at Retreats

In my experience at sex-positive retreats: **couples often have more drama than single people.**

Whatever crack exists in a relationship—whatever imperfection, whatever point of stress—it will surface at a retreat where people can flirt and have sex with others. One partner talks to someone attractive. The other feels jealous. Old wounds get triggered. Arguments happen.

Some couples are robust. They've been in these spaces for years. They love each other deeply. They play with others regularly and it brings them closer together. That's awesome.

Other couples are newer, or shaky, or came to the retreat hoping it would "fix" something. Those couples are riskier to engage with.

On average, couples bring more potential drama than single people. That's not a reason to avoid them entirely—just something to be aware of when you're deciding who to play with.

**Example questions:**

- "Are you in any relationships right now?"
- "Do you have any agreements with partners that affect what we can do?"
- "Is your partner here? Should I meet them first?"
- "How does your partner feel about you playing with others?"
- "Is there anyone who would be hurt or surprised by this?"
- "Is there anyone I should know about?"

---

## B — Boundaries

**What to discuss:** What's okay? What's not okay? What are your hard limits? What are your soft limits?

**Why it matters:** When you don't know someone's limits, respecting them becomes difficult. You're constantly second-guessing: "Can I do this? Can I do this?" That uncertainty creates anxiety for you and risk for them.

When you DO know their boundaries upfront:

- **You know what's safe.** You can play freely within the agreed space without constant questioning.
- **They're protected.** Clear limits are easier to respect than unstated ones.
- **You have ease.** You're not anxious about accidentally crossing a line you didn't know existed.
- **You're protected too.** If you were emotionally invested in something happening that wasn't actually available, knowing upfront prevents that hurt.

When someone hasn't thought through their boundaries beforehand, they're more likely to [fawn](./fawning.md) in the moment—saying yes when they mean no because they haven't practiced saying no to that specific thing. Then they feel violated afterward, even though they said yes.

### Hard Boundaries Stay Hard

This is extremely important:

**If someone sets a hard boundary, it does not get undone mid-scene.**

Even if things are getting hot and heavy. Even if they say "okay, you can do it." Even if they beg you to do it.

There was a reason they told you beforehand that they weren't okay with that thing. In the heat of the moment, arousal and pressure can override their actual limits. If you cross that line because they "gave permission" mid-scene, they may feel violated afterward, get hurt, or even play victim.

**Your responsibility:** If they stated a hard boundary before play, respect it until the scene is over and you're both thinking clearly. Then—and only then—you can have a conversation about whether they actually want to change that boundary for next time.

This protects them from themselves. It protects you from accusations. It's what responsible play looks like.

**Example questions:**

- "What's off-limits for you?"
- "What are your hard no's?"
- "Is there anything you'd want me to check in about before doing?"
- "How do you like to communicate if something isn't working?"
- "What's your safeword, if you use one?"

## D — Desires

**What to discuss:** What do you actually want from this experience? What are you hoping for? What would make this great for you?

**Why it matters:** If you don't know what each other wants, you're guessing. Guessing leads to mismatches. Mismatches lead to disappointment or harm.

**Hidden benefits:**

- **Discovery:** They might mention something you didn't realize you wanted until they said it. "Oh—I want that too!"
- **Creative alternatives:** Instead of just "no," they can practice "no, but..." If you ask for something they're not available for, they might offer something similar that works for both of you. This expands possibilities instead of closing them down.

### Some People Struggle to Ask

Many people have a hard time asking for what they really want.

Our culture often teaches us to serve others, suppress our desires, and not be "too demanding." Some people will list everything they want except the one thing they REALLY want—because that one feels too vulnerable to say.

Asking for what you want is a skill. It's one of the most important skills for getting what you want out of life. And in this conversation, you can support each other in developing it.

**How to help:**

- After they share their desires, ask: "Is there anything else? Anything you want but haven't said yet?"
- Be emotionally supportive as they try to articulate it. They might struggle. Give them space.
- Normalize it: "It's okay to ask for what you really want. I want to know."

Sometimes the thing they're hesitant to say is the thing that would make the experience actually great for them.

**Example questions:**

- "What are you hoping for from this?"
- "What would make this really good for you?"
- "Is there anything specific you'd love to experience?"
- "What are you curious about?"
- "Is there anything you want that you haven't said yet?"

## S — Sexual Health

**What to discuss:** STI status, testing history, safer sex practices, barriers, birth control, pregnancy.

**Why it matters:** This is about physical safety and informed consent. You can't consent to a risk you don't know about.

**Important:** If they have other partners or have had sex recently, ask what protection methods they used. A negative test from a month ago doesn't account for unprotected sex they had last week. You need the full picture.

**Example questions:**

- "When were you last tested? For what?"
- "Is there anything I should know about your sexual health?"
- "Have you had other partners since your last test? What protection did you use?"
- "What safer sex practices do you want to use?"
- "What are your preferences around barriers?"
- "What's your birth control situation?"
- "What would happen if pregnancy occurred? What would you want to do?"

---

## M — Meaning and Mistakes

**What to discuss:** What does this mean to you? What are your expectations afterward? And critically: **How do you respond when mistakes happen?**

### Meaning

Mismatched meaning creates hurt. If one person thinks this is the start of a relationship and the other thinks it's a one-time thing, someone's getting hurt—and it's preventable.

**Example questions:**

- "What does this mean to you?"
- "What are your expectations for after?"
- "Is this casual for you, or something more?"
- "Does having sex with someone change your relationship with them? How?"
- "How do you usually feel after intimacy? Is there anything you need?"

Some people's meaning-making is extreme. For a few people, sex means "we're basically married now." You want to know if that's in their head before you engage.

### Mistakes

This is one of the most important questions you can ask:

> **"When mistakes happen—when a boundary gets accidentally crossed—do you tend to assume the best in people, or the worst?"**

**Why this matters:**

You need to know if you're playing with a gun to your head.

If you accidentally cross a boundary for a moment—your hand goes somewhere it shouldn't, you misread a cue—what happens?

- **Charitable interpretation:** "Hey, I think you forgot, but I have a boundary about that." You say "Oh, thank you for telling me," and appreciate their respectful response.
- **Uncharitable interpretation:** You're a rapist. Character assassination. Reputation destruction. [Witch hunt](./before-you-judge.md).

If you know someone responds to mistakes with HIGH severity—treating accidents like malice—you might choose not to play with them. You might choose someone whose interpretation of mistakes is charitable, who understands the difference between [accident and malice](./types-of-mistakes.md).

**Example questions:**

- "When someone makes a mistake with you, how do you usually respond?"
- "If I accidentally crossed a boundary, what would you want me to do? What would you do?"
- "Do you tend to assume good intent when things go wrong?"
- "Have you ever had an experience where someone made an innocent mistake and you responded strongly? What happened?"

This isn't about finding someone who will let you get away with things. It's about knowing what you're signing up for. If they can't tolerate accidents, and you're human (meaning you WILL make mistakes eventually), you're playing with fire.

---

## T — Trauma

**What to discuss:** Do you have any trauma that might get activated? What does activation look like for you? What should I do if it happens?

**Why it matters:** Trauma can turn a consensual experience into a dissociative nightmare. If you know their triggers and warning signs, you can navigate around them—or at least respond appropriately if something comes up.

**Example questions:**

- "Is there anything from your past that might get activated during play?"
- "Are there any touches, words, or situations I should avoid?"
- "What does it look like when you're activated or triggered?"
- "What would you want me to do if that happens?"
- "Do you have any [fawning](./fawning.md) patterns I should watch for?"

That last question is powerful. If they tell you upfront that they tend to fawn, you can watch for it and check in when their "yes" doesn't feel like a yes.

### Your Trauma Matters Too

This isn't just about their trauma—it's about yours.

**Personal example:** I have exclusion trauma. I spent years feeling left out, and I have trauma around not being touched. I was playing with someone who had the opposite—trauma about being touched too much. They were hesitant to touch me, which made sense for them, but I forgot to tell them about MY trauma.

Now I have a request I make upfront:

> "If we're headed toward sex and you decide you're no longer interested, please tell me immediately—as soon as you become aware. I have trauma around expecting something and then being let down. If I know early, I can adjust. If I find out at the last moment, it's much harder for me."

That's me taking [responsibility](./responsibility.md) for my own trauma. Not expecting them to read my mind—but communicating what I need so we can both have a good experience.

## This Is Taking Responsibility

Having this conversation before play is [taking responsibility](./responsibility.md) proactively.

You're not waiting for something to go wrong and then trying to repair it. You're creating the conditions for a **good thing**—where both people feel good during AND after.

**For facilitators:** Teaching participants to have this conversation before play is part of preparing them for temple nights and open play. If you skip this education, you're setting people up for the mistakes this book is about.

See: [Facilitator Protocols](./facilitator-protocols.md) — the responsible vs. irresponsible approach.

## A Personal Note from the Author

When I first learned RBDSMT, I thought: "This is great."

Then, a few months later, things are getting hot with someone. We're about to have sex. And I think: "Do I really need to have the full conversation? We're both adults. It'll probably be fine."

I skipped it. We had sex. And afterward, it wasn't a good thing. There was pain. Mismatched meaning. Hurt feelings. Drama.

I did that two or three more times. Each time, I skipped the conversation because it felt awkward or unnecessary in the moment. Each time, something went wrong.

Now? I have the full RBDSMT conversation every time before sex. No compromises. No exceptions. No "it's probably fine."

Because I'm tired of having sex and feeling like shit afterward. I'm tired of creating bad things when I could create good things. And the only difference is 15 minutes of conversation that I was too lazy or awkward to have.

Learn from my mistakes. Have the conversation.

---

## It Doesn't Have to Be Awkward

Some people resist these conversations because they feel clinical or mood-killing.

But:

1. **It can be sexy.** Talking about desires is foreplay. Knowing what someone wants makes it better.

2. **It builds trust.** Someone who's willing to have this conversation is someone who cares about your experience.

3. **It prevents way more awkwardness than it creates.** A 15-minute conversation now prevents hours of processing, repair, and drama later.

4. **It's a filter.** Someone who won't have this conversation is telling you something about how they'll handle things when they go wrong.
