# The Drama Triangle

## What Is It?

The **Karpman Drama Triangle** is a model of dysfunctional social dynamics. When conflict happens, people unconsciously fall into one of three roles:

```
                    PERSECUTOR
                        ▲
                       / \
                      /   \
                     /     \
                    /       \
                   /         \
                  /           \
           VICTIM ───────────── RESCUER
```

These roles are unstable. People switch between them constantly, creating cycles of drama that never resolve.

## The Three Roles

### Victim

> "Poor me. This is happening TO me. I'm helpless."

- Feels powerless, oppressed, hopeless
- Doesn't take [responsibility](./responsibility.md)
- Waits to be rescued or persecuted
- May actually have been harmed—but stays stuck in helplessness

### Persecutor

> "It's YOUR fault. You're bad and you deserve punishment."

- Blames, criticizes, attacks
- Treats others as the problem
- May feel justified (especially if they started as Victim)
- Creates new victims

### Rescuer

> "Let me save you. You need me."

- Jumps in to fix, help, save
- Enables the Victim to stay helpless
- Often has their own needs (feeling needed, avoiding their own issues)
- Gets resentful when not appreciated

## The Cycle

The roles aren't stable. People rotate through them:

1. **Victim** gets tired of being helpless → becomes **Persecutor** ("It's YOUR fault!")
2. **Persecutor** feels guilty → becomes **Rescuer** ("Let me fix it")
3. **Rescuer** feels unappreciated → becomes **Victim** ("After everything I did for you!")

This is why drama never ends. The roles feed each other.

## How This Shows Up in Intimacy Spaces

| Situation        | Drama Triangle Version                                             |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Boundary crossed | Victim stays helpless, waits for Rescuer to fix it                 |
| Conflict arises  | Persecutor attacks, recruits others to persecute too               |
| Someone is hurt  | Rescuer swoops in, doesn't let them process, enables               |
| Mob judgment     | Group becomes Persecutor, target becomes Victim, no one steps back |

See: [Before You Judge](./before-you-judge.md) — mob dynamics often follow this pattern.

## The Alternative: The Empowerment Dynamic

There's a healthier version of each role. This is called **The Empowerment Dynamic (TED)**, created by David Emerald:

```
                    CHALLENGER
                        ▲
                       / \
                      /   \
                     /     \
                    /       \
                   /         \
                  /           \
           CREATOR ───────────── COACH
```

### Creator (instead of Victim)

> "This happened. What do I want to create now? What's my power here?"

- Acknowledges reality without being defined by it
- Focuses on outcomes, not problems
- Takes [responsibility](./responsibility.md) and [100% control](../tools/100-percent-control.md)

### Challenger (instead of Persecutor)

> "I'm going to push you—not to hurt you, but to help you grow."

- Holds others accountable with compassion
- Challenges behavior without attacking personhood
- Speaks truth without cruelty

### Coach (instead of Rescuer)

> "I believe in your ability to handle this. How can I support you?"

- Supports without enabling
- Asks questions instead of giving answers
- Empowers others to find their own solutions
- Doesn't need to be needed

## The Shift

| Drama Triangle | →   | Empowerment Dynamic |
| -------------- | --- | ------------------- |
| Victim         | →   | Creator             |
| Persecutor     | →   | Challenger          |
| Rescuer        | →   | Coach               |

### For Teaching (Simplified)

```
DRAMA:                          HEALTHY:

    Persecutor                      Challenger
         ▲                              ▲
        / \                            / \
       /   \                          /   \
  Victim ── Rescuer             Creator ── Coach

  (roles rotate)                (roles stable)
  (reactive)                    (chosen)
  (stuck)                       (empowered)
```

The key difference: **Agency.**

In the Drama Triangle, everyone is reactive and stuck.
In the Empowerment Dynamic, everyone has power and choice.

## Questions to Ask Yourself

- Am I acting from Victim, Persecutor, or Rescuer right now?
- What would Creator, Challenger, or Coach do instead?
- Am I enabling someone's helplessness?
- Am I attacking someone instead of challenging them with care?
- Am I waiting to be saved instead of taking my power?
