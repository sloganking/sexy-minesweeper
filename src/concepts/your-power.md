# How Much Power Do You Have? _(Draft)_

## Where Most People Are

Most people believe they are small.

They believe:

- "I can only affect what's directly in front of me"
- "I don't have the power to change big things"
- "Life happens TO me—I just react"
- "Some people are powerful. I'm not one of them."

This isn't a personal failing. It's cultural programming. We're taught from childhood that we're limited, that we should "be realistic," that big achievements are for special people—not us.

And so most people don't take responsibility for things they don't believe they can affect. Why would they? If you genuinely believe you have no power over something, taking responsibility for it feels absurd.

## The Confronting Question

What if that's a lie?

What if you have far more power than you've been taught to see?

What if the only thing keeping you small is the belief that you ARE small?

## Evidence That People Break Through

Consider:

- **Tony Robbins** grew up so poor his family could barely feed itself. Now he's fed over 60 billion meals through charity. He went from nothing to billionaire to global impact.

- **Oprah Winfrey** was born into poverty, experienced abuse, and became one of the most influential people on the planet.

- Every major social change—civil rights, women's suffrage, the end of apartheid—happened because individuals believed they could affect something "too big" for them to affect.

Here's what I want you to consider:

> **There is nothing I or anyone else can do that you can't.**

Not because you're special. Because you're human. And humans have more creative power than we're taught to believe.

## The Cultural Delusion

Our culture teaches that:

- Power is finite and limited
- Only certain people have it
- You should "know your place"
- Wanting big things is arrogant
- Life happens to you; you respond

This is the water we swim in. It's so pervasive we don't notice it.

But it's a delusion. It's not how reality works. It's a story we've been told so many times that we forgot to question it.

## What If You're Omnipotent?

Here's the radical claim:

**You have unlimited creative potential.**

Not in a woo-woo, "manifest with your thoughts" way. In a practical way:

- You can affect anything you choose to focus on
- Your sphere of influence is limited only by your belief about what's possible
- The things you think are "too big for you" are only too big because you believe they are

**Omnipotent** doesn't mean you can snap your fingers and change physics. It means: there is no category of thing that is inherently beyond your ability to influence. Given enough time, focus, and action, you can affect anything.

Most people are asleep to this. They've accepted the cultural story of their own smallness. They've stopped looking for power in places where they've been told it doesn't exist.

But the power is still there. Waiting for them to see it.

## Why This Matters for Responsibility

Remember: you can only take responsibility for things you believe you have power over.

If you believe your power is limited, your responsibility is limited. You can only take responsibility for the small sphere you think you control.

But if you see your power as vast—if you recognize that you can influence far more than you've been taught—then your responsibility expands to match.

**Omni-responsibility follows from omnipotence.**

I take responsibility for everything because I recognize I have the power to influence everything.

## Even If You Don't Fully Believe This

Maybe this feels too big. Too confronting. Too different from how you've always seen yourself.

That's okay. Here's the minimum version:

> **You are responsible for everything you have the power to influence—and you probably have more power than you think.**

Even if you don't buy the "unlimited" part, consider: What if you're underestimating yourself by 10x? By 100x?

What if you've been living inside a much smaller box than you need to?

---

## The Invitation

I'm not asking you to believe this intellectually. I'm asking you to consider:

**What if this were true?**

- How would you act differently?
- What would you attempt that you've dismissed as "not for someone like me"?
- What would you take responsibility for that you've been avoiding?

Try it on. See what happens.

The people who break through—who build things, change things, affect the world at scale—aren't fundamentally different from you. They just stopped believing the story of their own smallness.

You can stop believing it too.

## Hidden in Plain Sight

This knowledge isn't secret because it's locked away. It's secret because when people hear it, they don't believe it.

It's an open secret. A Cassandra truth. Hidden in plain sight.

Everyone who's broken through knows this. They can tell you directly: "You have more power than you think." But most people hear it and dismiss it. They think: "That's nice, but it doesn't apply to me."

It does apply to you. That's the whole point.
