# How Much Power Do You Have?

## Where Most People Are

Most people believe they are small.

They believe:

- "I can only affect what's directly in front of me"
- "I don't have the power to change big things"
- "Life happens TO me—I just react"
- "Some people are powerful. I'm not one of them."

This isn't a personal failing. It's cultural programming. We're taught from childhood that we're limited, that we should "be realistic," that big achievements are for special people—not us.

And so most people don't take responsibility for things they don't believe they can affect. Why would they? If you genuinely believe you have no power over something, taking responsibility for it feels absurd.

## The Confronting Question

What if that's a lie?

What if you have far more power than you've been taught to see?

What if the only thing keeping you small is the belief that you ARE small?

## Evidence That People Break Through

Consider:

- **Tony Robbins** grew up so poor his family could barely feed itself. Now he's fed over 60 billion meals through charity. He went from nothing to billionaire to global impact.

- Every major social change—civil rights, women's suffrage, the end of apartheid—happened because individuals believed they could affect something "too big" for them to affect.

- In these spaces: participants who seemed "powerless" have shaped entire containers, protected people from witch hunts, and changed how facilitators run their events—simply by speaking up, standing their ground, or offering perspective no one else had.

Here's what I want you to consider:

> **There is nothing anyone has done or can do that you can't do as well.**

Not because you're special. Because you're human. And humans have **unlimited creative potential**.

### The Chessboard

Think of it like a chessboard.

You might start at a different position than someone else. You might have different rules about where you can move next—different constraints, different circumstances, different resources available right now.

But ultimately, **you can get to any position on the board that they can get to.**

Your starting square is not your destiny. The rules of your next move are not permanent. Given enough moves, enough persistence—any square is reachable.

**In these spaces, this means:** You're not stuck in the position of "victim" or "powerless participant." Even if someone wronged you, even if you're being attacked, even if a mob is forming—you have moves. You can affect how this unfolds. You can shape the outcome. The square you're on right now is not where you have to stay.

## The Cultural Delusion

Our culture teaches that:

- Power is finite and limited
- Only certain people have it
- You should "know your place"
- Wanting big things is arrogant

You see this everywhere. A participant in a workshop thinks the facilitator has all the power—but they're wrong. The participant can dramatically shape what happens through their presence, questions, and willingness to speak up. They can even destroy the facilitator's reputation with a single accusation. They have enormous power—they just don't see it because they've been taught to see themselves as powerless.

(See: [Power Dynamics](./power-dynamics.md) for how this plays out in containers.)

- Life happens to you; you respond

This is the water we swim in. It's so pervasive we don't notice it.

But it's a delusion. It's not how reality works. It's a story we've been told so many times that we forgot to question it.

## What If You're Omnipotent?

Here's the radical claim:

**You have unlimited creative potential.**

Not in a woo-woo, "manifest with your thoughts" way. In a practical way:

- You can affect anything you choose to focus on
- Your sphere of influence is limited only by your belief about what's possible
- The things you think are "too big for you" are only too big because you believe they are

**Omnipotent** doesn't mean you can snap your fingers and change physics. It means: there is no category of thing that is inherently beyond your ability to influence. Given enough time, focus, and action, you can affect anything.

Most people are asleep to this. They've accepted the cultural story of their own smallness. They've stopped looking for power in places where they've been told it doesn't exist.

But the power is still there. Waiting for them to see it.

## Omnipotent → Omniresponsible

Here's the connection that ties everything together:

> **You can only take responsibility for things you believe you have power over.**

If you believe your power is limited, your responsibility is limited. You can only take responsibility for the small sphere you think you control.

But if you see yourself as **omnipotent**—if you recognize that you can influence far more than you've been taught—then your responsibility expands to match.

**Omniresponsibility follows from omnipotence.**

### You Are Responsible for the Entire World

Once you recognize your unlimited power, the logical conclusion is:

> **You are responsible for the entire world and everything in it.**

Before you recoil—this is not about blame. Not about burden. Not about obligation.

The world is not something that happens TO you. **The world is your creation.**

Responsibility is simply how you recognize your power. Taking responsibility for the whole world is simply recognizing that your actions can affect everything and everyone. Every person you interact with, every system you participate in, every choice you make or don't make—these ripple outward. Everything and everyone are partially your creation, through your action or inaction.

**"But I can't affect the entire world."**

That's a story. Like all the stories and limiting beliefs discussed in [Trauma & Filters](./trauma-and-filters.md), it's just a belief you've been carrying around. It feels true because you've never questioned it. But it's not reality. It's a filter.

### Identity Precedes Action

Here's the practical piece:

**As soon as you realize you're able to affect big things, you start taking actions to do it.**

The person who believes they can only affect their immediate circle acts accordingly—small moves, limited scope. The person who believes they can affect the world acts accordingly—bigger moves, wider impact.

Your identity determines your actions. Change the identity, and the actions follow.

**In these spaces, this means:** If you see yourself as a helpless participant who can't stand up to an angry accuser, you'll act that way—you'll [fawn](./fawning.md), appease, accept blame that isn't yours. But if you see yourself as someone with real power to affect outcomes, you'll act differently—you'll hold your ground, set boundaries, decline false responsibility.

The first step to affecting the world is believing you can. The first step to handling conflict with power is believing you have any.

## Why This Matters for the Drama Triangle

You've seen the [Drama Triangle](./drama-triangle.md)—the choice between Victim and Creator.

Here's the connection: **Seeing yourself as having unlimited creative potential is the only way to be a Creator at all times.**

If you believe your power is limited, there will always be situations where you feel forced into Victim mode. "In THIS situation, I really AM powerless. I have no choice but to be a Victim here."

But if you recognize that your power is unlimited—that there is no domain where you are fundamentally incapable of affecting outcomes—then Creator is always available. There is no situation where Victim is your only option.

This is why the Creator role isn't just a nice idea for easy situations. It's a stance you can hold everywhere, always—because your power to create is everywhere, always.

## Even If You Don't Fully Believe This

Maybe this feels too big. Too confronting. Too different from how you've always seen yourself.

That's okay. Here's the minimum version:

> **You are responsible for everything you have the power to influence—and you probably have more power than you think.**

Even if you don't buy the "unlimited" part, consider: What if you're underestimating yourself by 10x? By 100x?

What if you've been living inside a much smaller box than you need to?

## The Invitation

I'm not asking you to believe this intellectually. I'm asking you to consider:

**What if this were true?**

- How would you act differently when someone accuses you unfairly?
- How would you show up in a container if you knew you could shape what happens?
- What responsibility would you take for outcomes you've been blaming on others?
- What boundaries would you set if you believed you had the power to enforce them?

Try it on. See what happens.

The people who navigate these spaces with grace—who don't get swept up in witch hunts, who hold their ground when attacked, who take responsibility without accepting false blame—aren't fundamentally different from you. They just stopped believing the story of their own powerlessness.

You can stop believing it too.

## Hidden in Plain Sight

This knowledge isn't secret because it's locked away. It's secret because when people hear it, they don't believe it.

It's an open secret. A Cassandra truth. Hidden in plain sight.

Everyone who's broken through knows this. They can tell you directly: "You have more power than you think." But most people hear it and dismiss it. They think: "That's nice, but it doesn't apply to me."

It does apply to you. That's the whole point.
