# Types of Mistakes

← [Back to Introduction](../introduction.md)

---

Here's what destroys people in these spaces:

**Treating an accident like malice.**

Someone's hand slips. Someone misreads a cue. Someone gets carried away for a moment. It was unconscious, unintentional, immediately regretted.

And then the response: "Predator." "You need to leave and never come back." Public shaming. Reputation destroyed.

A LOW or MEDIUM severity accident. Met with a HIGH severity response designed for malice.

**The person who made the mistake wasn't the predator. The person who responded became one.**

This is why TYPE matters. The same action can be malicious or accidental—and the appropriate response is completely different. Get the type wrong, and you become the source of harm.

## By Intent

| Type          | Description                  | Response                              |
| ------------- | ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| **Malicious** | Intentional harm             | Accountability, consequences          |
| **Accident**  | Unintentional, unconscious   | Education, awareness                  |
| **Fawning**   | Person said yes but meant no | Complex — see [Fawning](./fawning.md) |

## By Awareness

| Type                          | Description                                                                         |
| ----------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Conscious, wrong thinking** | They were thinking, but thinking wrong                                              |
| **Unconscious, not thinking** | Autopilot, sleepy, careless — the [Popcorn](../tools/popcorn-metaphor.md) situation |

### How to Use the Matrix

Ask two questions:

1. **Did they mean to do it?** (Intentional vs Unintentional)
2. **Were they thinking?** (Conscious vs Unconscious)

The answers point you to the quadrant, and the quadrant tells you the response.

**Note on Fawning:** Fawning doesn't fit cleanly in this matrix—it's a trauma response that creates two victims. See [Fawning](./fawning.md).

## Why Unconscious Mistakes Happen

The unconscious quadrant (ACCIDENT) can have different underlying causes:

### Autopilot

Familiar patterns run when you zone out. You didn't want the outcome; your body just did what it habitually does in that context.

Think about driving somewhere familiar. You meant to go to the store, but you zoned out—and five minutes later you realize you're driving home instead. You didn't *want* to go home. It's just the pattern your body runs when you're not paying attention.

**How severe can autopilot get?**

In [Target Focus Training](https://targetfocustraining.com/)—a reality-based self-protection program—there's a rule: when you're done practicing with a weapon, you *never* hand it to your partner. You drop it on the ground and let them pick it up—even when it's their turn to use it in the next exercise.

Why? Because there are documented cases of people defending themselves from an attacker—successfully fending them off with a gun or knife—and then, in shock, *handing the weapon to their attacker*. The threat isn't over. The attacker could kill them. But their body, running on autopilot after the adrenaline spike, does what it did in practice: hand the weapon to your partner when you're done.

This makes no logical sense. It could literally end your life. But autopilot doesn't care about logic. It runs the pattern that was trained, regardless of context.

**In intimate spaces**, this can mean your body goes through familiar motions (touch, escalation, movement) without conscious engagement. Not because you wanted to cross a boundary—but because that's what autopilot does in that context.

**How to actually prevent autopilot mistakes:**

"Stay conscious" isn't useful advice—you can't consciously prevent an unconscious problem.

The real solution is what Target Focus Training does: **train the safety check into the habit itself.** They never hand the weapon to their partner—they drop it, partner picks it up. The check is part of the trained sequence. Even on autopilot, the safety mechanism fires.

In intimate spaces, this could look like:

- **Verbal check:** Train yourself to always ask before escalating to genital touch. Every time. Until it's automatic.
- **Self-check:** Train yourself to run the [Gun Test](../tools/gun-test.md) before any significant escalation.
- **Physical action:** Train a physical ritual with your partner—like a fist bump or specific gesture—that always precedes escalation. Your body learns: do this motion first.

**The worst-case scenario with this training:**

You're on autopilot, heading toward genital touch. Your trained habit triggers—you ask, or you do the gesture. Maybe it doesn't even make sense (they already told you their boundary). But you ask anyway, because that's what your autopilot does. They remind you: "No, that's my boundary." You wake up: "Oh right, I already knew that."

**No harm done.** The autopilot safety caught you before you crossed the line.

The goal isn't to never zone out—that's unrealistic. The goal is to make your autopilot itself safe, by training checks into the sequence before high-stakes actions.

### Hunger

Unmet needs—sexual, emotional, connection—can drive the subconscious to reach for what it wants when the conscious mind isn't watching.

Think about consciously deciding not to eat candy, but there's candy on your desk. You zone out while working. Your hand reaches for the candy before you realize what you're doing. The want existed; your conscious mind overruled it; when you zoned out, the want drove the action.

This is why [feeding yourself first](./facilitator-protocols.md#staff-readiness-feed-yourself-first) matters—especially for facilitators and staff. A well-fed animal body is safer on autopilot.

### Impairment

The conscious mind isn't at full capacity. Tired, medicated, intoxicated, emotionally activated.

When your conscious mind is running at 40%, your unconscious has more control. Mistakes become more likely—not because you wanted to make them, but because the part of you that would have stopped them wasn't fully online.

This is the classic [Popcorn Metaphor](../tools/popcorn-metaphor.md) situation—you've done something successfully a thousand times, but this time you were sleepy or impaired, and an accident happened. The [Gun Test](../tools/gun-test.md) helps you catch when you're too impaired to play safely.

### Different Causes → Different Prevention

| Cause | Prevention |
|-------|------------|
| **Autopilot** | Train safety checks into the habit. Make your autopilot itself safe. |
| **Hunger** | Feed yourself first. Address unmet needs before entering high-stakes situations. |
| **Impairment** | Gun Test. Don't play when you're not fit to play. |

Sometimes it's one cause. Sometimes it's a combination. Sometimes you don't know which it was. But understanding that unconscious mistakes have *causes*—and those causes have *prevention strategies*—gives you ways to reduce the risk.

### A Personal Example

I made my first significant unconscious mistake at a retreat. What happened was my hand strayed somewhere it shouldn't have. For one second. A [popcorn metaphor](../tools/popcorn-metaphor.md) moment—unconscious, automatic, not a choice I made consciously.

When I tried to understand why it happened, I was confused. The action didn't line up with my identity. I only want to create good things. Things where everyone participating feels good both during and after. I'm completely disinterested in crossing boundaries. So why did my body do something I would never consciously choose?

Here's what was happening inside me:

```
Conscious Mind:    ████████░░░░░░░░░░░░  40%
Unconscious Mind:  ████████████░░░░░░░░  60%
```

My conscious mind had less than half the control. My animal body was driving.

Looking back, I was probably failing all three causes of unconscious mistakes:

1. **Impairment:** I was on sleeping medication. I was tired. I would have failed the [Gun Test](../tools/gun-test.md)—though I didn't have that lesson yet.

2. **Hunger:** I hadn't had sex for a while before that retreat. My animal body was unfulfilled.

3. **Autopilot:** I had no trained safety checks. No muscle memory for pre-escalation pauses. No ingrained habit of asking before touching. My autopilot had no safety mechanisms built in.

I don't know which cause was primary. Maybe it was all three working together. What I know is that my conscious mind wasn't driving—and I had nothing in place to catch me when it slipped.

**This experience is why I created these rules.**

The [Gun Test](../tools/gun-test.md). The [feed-yourself-first principle](./facilitator-protocols.md#staff-readiness-feed-yourself-first). The idea of [training safety checks into your autopilot](#how-to-actually-prevent-autopilot-mistakes). All of it came from this moment—from trying to understand how a good person with good intentions could do something they would never consciously choose.

The lesson isn't just "stay conscious." That's incomplete—you can't consciously prevent an unconscious problem.

The lesson is: **control the back end too.**

- Feed yourself, so hunger doesn't drive your autopilot
- Check your impairment, so you don't play when you're not fit
- Train safety checks into your habits, so your autopilot itself is safe

You don't just prevent mistakes by staying conscious. You prevent them by making your unconscious safer—so that even when you slip, the damage is contained.
