# Types of Mistakes

← [Back to Introduction](../introduction.md)

---

Here's what destroys people in these spaces:

**Treating an accident like malice.**

Someone's hand slips. Someone misreads a cue. Someone gets carried away for a moment. It was unconscious, unintentional, immediately regretted.

And then the response: "Predator." "Rapist." "You need to leave and never come back." Public shaming. Reputation destroyed.

A LOW or MEDIUM severity accident. Met with a HIGH severity response designed for malice.

**The person who made the mistake wasn't the predator. The person who responded became one.**

This is why TYPE matters. The same action can be malicious or accidental—and the appropriate response is completely different. Get the type wrong, and you become the source of harm.

## The Core Types

| Type          | Description                  | What It Looks Like | Response                              |
| ------------- | ---------------------------- | ------------------ | ------------------------------------- |
| **Malicious** | Intentional harm             | They knew. They did it anyway. They wanted to. | Accountability, consequences          |
| **Accident**  | Unintentional, unconscious   | Hand slipped. Got carried away. Didn't notice. | Education, awareness                  |
| **Wrong Thinking** | Conscious but misguided | They thought it was okay. It wasn't. | Correct the belief                    |
| **Fawning**   | Person said yes but meant no | Two victims. See [Fawning](./fawning.md). | Complex—both have responsibility |

## By Awareness

| Type                          | Description                                                                         |
| ----------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Conscious, wrong thinking** | They were thinking, but thinking wrong                                              |
| **Unconscious, not thinking** | Autopilot, sleepy, careless — the [Popcorn](../tools/popcorn-metaphor.md) situation |

The difference matters:

- **Wrong thinking** needs education. They believed something false—like "hickeys just happen" or "silence means consent." Correct the belief, and the behavior changes.

- **Unconscious** needs a wake-up call. They weren't thinking at all. They need to become aware, not be taught—they probably already know better when they're conscious.

## Other Patterns

| Type                    | Description                                                                |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Freezing**            | Person went silent/still instead of communicating. Trauma response, like fawning. |
| **Assumption**          | "Last time they liked this." Filling in blanks instead of asking.          |
| **Delayed Realization** | Consented in the moment, realized later it wasn't okay. Both acted in good faith. |
| **Miscommunication**    | Both thought they understood, neither did.                                 |
| **Aftercare Failure**   | Act was consensual, aftermath was neglected.                               |

### How to Use the Matrix

Ask two questions:

1. **Did they mean to do it?** (Intentional vs Unintentional)
2. **Were they thinking?** (Conscious vs Unconscious)

The answers point you to the quadrant, and the quadrant tells you the response.

**Note on Fawning:** Fawning doesn't fit cleanly in this matrix—it's a trauma response that creates two victims. See [Fawning](./fawning.md).
