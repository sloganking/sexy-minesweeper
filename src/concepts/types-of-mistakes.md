# Types of Mistakes

← [Back to Introduction](../introduction.md)

---

Here's what destroys people in these spaces:

**Treating an accident like malice.**

Someone's hand slips. Someone misreads a cue. Someone gets carried away for a moment. It was unconscious, unintentional, immediately regretted.

And then the response: "Predator." "You need to leave and never come back." Public shaming. Reputation destroyed.

A LOW or MEDIUM severity accident. Met with a HIGH severity response designed for malice.

**The person who made the mistake wasn't the predator. The person who responded became one.**

This is why TYPE matters. The same action can be malicious or accidental—and the appropriate response is completely different. Get the type wrong, and you become the source of harm.

## By Intent

| Type          | Description                  | Response                              |
| ------------- | ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| **Malicious** | Intentional harm             | Accountability, consequences          |
| **Accident**  | Unintentional, unconscious   | Education, awareness                  |
| **Fawning**   | Person said yes but meant no | Complex — see [Fawning](./fawning.md) |

## By Awareness

| Type                          | Description                                                                         |
| ----------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Conscious, wrong thinking** | They were thinking, but thinking wrong                                              |
| **Unconscious, not thinking** | Autopilot, sleepy, careless — the [Popcorn](../tools/popcorn-metaphor.md) situation |

                 └───────────────────┴───────────────────┘

### How to Use the Matrix

Ask two questions:

1. **Did they mean to do it?** (Intentional vs Unintentional)
2. **Were they thinking?** (Conscious vs Unconscious)

The answers point you to the quadrant, and the quadrant tells you the response.

**Note on Fawning:** Fawning doesn't fit cleanly in this matrix—it's a trauma response that creates two victims. See [Fawning](./fawning.md).
