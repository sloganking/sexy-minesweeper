# Appropriate Response

← [Back to Introduction](../introduction.md)

---

## The Principle

> **If you cry victim hard enough, you become the perpetrator.**

Getting the balance right—responding to the [severity](./severity.md) level of an incident appropriately—is paramount to creating something good in the world and not becoming a source of harm yourself.

## Response vs Severity

```
Severity:    LOW ──────── MEDIUM ──────── HIGH

Response:    LOW ──────── MEDIUM ──────── HIGH

✓ APPROPRIATE: Response matches severity
✗ UNDER-RESPONSE: Enables continued harm
✗ OVER-RESPONSE: Creates new harm, new victims
```

## Unqualified Response = Over-Response

There's another way to fail this test: **responding when you don't actually know what happened.**

See: [Before You Judge](./before-you-judge.md)

If you're not a [qualified source](./before-you-judge.md#are-you-a-qualified-source)—if you haven't verified with primary sources, if you're going on vibes or gossip—then **any disciplinary action you take is automatically an over-response.**

Why? Because you don't know what you're responding to.

- You might be punishing someone for something that didn't happen
- You might be treating LOW severity as HIGH because someone was loud about it
- You might be responding to a distorted version of events
- You might be creating harm based on fiction

```
If UNQUALIFIED:
  → Any response > NONE is over-response
  → You are now a source of harm
```

The severity chart assumes you know what happened. If you don't, you can't use it yet. **Get qualified first.**

### "But I Was Right"

Here's the loophole people use: "I didn't verify, but the person turned out to actually be a predator. So my response was justified."

No. You got lucky.

If you take high-severity action without doing due diligence—without checking your [stories](./trauma-and-filters.md), without verifying with primary sources, without using every tool available to see clearly—you're walking blindfolded into a minefield. If you happen not to step on a mine, that's not responsibility. That's chance.

The person you're responding to might deserve a high-severity response. Or they might not. If you didn't check, you don't know which. And if you're wrong, you've just caused irreversible harm to an innocent person.

**Being right by accident is not the same as being responsible.** The responsible person verifies first, then responds. The irresponsible person responds first and hopes they were right. One is creating safety. The other is gambling with other people's lives.

## Common Inappropriate Responses

| Response                     | What It Looks Like                     |
| ---------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| **Scorched Earth**           | Treating accidents like malice         |
| **Public Shaming**           | Using community power to punish        |
| **Weaponized Vulnerability** | Using victim status offensively        |
| **Silence/Avoidance**        | Never addressing it, letting it fester |
| **Triangulation**            | Recruiting others to take sides        |
| **Eye for an Eye**           | Trying to hurt them back equally       |
| **Mob Judgment**             | Group condemns without verification    |

## How Trauma Distorts Response

See: [Trauma & Filters](./trauma-and-filters.md)

When you have unprocessed trauma:

- LOW severity feels like HIGH
- Accidents feel like malice
- Your response escalates beyond what's warranted
- You become a source of harm while feeling like a victim

When a mistake happens, follow this process:

### Simplified Steps

1. PAUSE
2. VERIFIED? (Have I talked to the people involved? If NO → STOP)
3. SEVERITY? (Low / Medium / High)
4. TYPE? (Malicious / Accident / Fawning)
5. NOW or PAST? (Check your trauma)
6. MATCH RESPONSE to SEVERITY
7. AIM for REPAIR

## Assume Good Intent

By default, always assume the best about the person who made the mistake—until you have qualified information that demonstrates otherwise.

When someone crosses a boundary, assume they got carried away and forgot. Say something like:

> "Hey, I assume you forgot, but as a polite reminder—my boundary is that I'm not available for this. You can't do that to me right now."

**Nine times out of ten, the mistake was unconscious.** They'll apologize, maybe profusely, and likely take action to make it right.

This approach:

- Helps them grow and become more conscious
- Enforces your boundaries without attacking
- Doesn't tolerate the behavior
- Offers a chance for repair instead of punishment
- Can lead to a net positive outcome where they add more value than was taken

The alternative—vilifying them, calling them a predator, demanding they leave—might feel righteous, but it:

- Destroys any chance of repair
- Creates an enemy instead of an ally
- Often causes more harm than the original mistake
- Makes YOU the source of harm

## Give People an Opportunity to Win

When someone wrongs you, show them a way to win with you. Don't just say "you need to make this right"—that's not a sequence of actions they can follow.

**Make a precise ask.**

Tell them exactly what you would like. They're not obligated to say yes, but now they have:

- A clear path to repair
- Understanding of what matters to you
- The option to meet your ask, exceed it, or offer something even better

When you give someone a clear way to win, you might end up with an outcome that's net positive—where the repair was done so well that you got more value from the interaction than was taken.

That's not possible if you attack first.

## Report to Facilitators

Nine times out of ten, people making mistakes are not predators. They're making honest mistakes.

But it's still important to **communicate what happened to the facilitators of the event**—even if you handled it yourself, even if it felt minor.

Why?

- Facilitators hear about incidents you haven't
- They can track patterns across participants
- If someone is crossing boundaries regularly, that changes the assessment

Someone who makes mistakes repeatedly is either:

1. **Malicious** — and action needs to be taken to remove them
2. **Extremely clumsy** — unconscious mistakes happening too often, needs intervention. Or they might be operating at a lower severity level than they should be—easily correctable with guidance.
3. **Operating from misguided thinking** — needs correction, but could become an outstanding community member with guidance

The facilitators can figure out which it is and handle it appropriately. But they can only do that if people tell them what's happening.

**Don't just let it slide.** Let the facilitators know.

### Warning Signs You're Over-Responding

- You want to hurt them back
- You want others to take your side
- You're treating an accident like malice
- Your response would cause more harm than their mistake did
- **You don't actually know what happened** (you're going on vibes or gossip)
