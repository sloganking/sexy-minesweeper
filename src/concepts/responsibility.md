## Most People Don't Understand Responsibility

Here's the problem: most people have a broken understanding of what responsibility even means.

They think:

- Responsibility is what the **perpetrator** takes after making a mistake
- The **victim** is the one who demands responsibility
- The victim has nothing to be responsible for
- Responsibility = punishment for wrongdoing

This is completely wrong.

And because of this misunderstanding, you see dynamics like:

- Someone makes a mistake
- A group gathers and says "You need to take responsibility!"
- Meanwhile, none of the accusers are taking any responsibility themselves
- For their [mob judgment](./before-you-judge.md), for their [over-response](./appropriate-response.md), for their role in what happened

Everyone is pointing fingers. No one is looking at themselves.

## What Responsibility Actually Means

Responsibility means asking:

> **What happened? How did my actions—or inactions—play a part in creating this outcome? What can I do in the future to create something else I want instead?**

That's it. It's not about fault. It's not about punishment. It's not about being "the bad guy."

It's about recognizing your power and using it intentionally.

Note: it's actions **or inactions**. What you didn't do is just as much a part of what you created as what you did do.

## Everyone Has Responsibility

In any interaction between two or more people, **everyone** has responsibility for the outcome.

Not just the "perpetrator." Not just the person who made the most obvious mistake. Everyone.

| Person                                | Has Responsibility For                                        |
| ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| The person who crossed a boundary     | Their actions, their lack of check-ins, their unawareness     |
| The person whose boundary was crossed | Vetting who they play with, not communicating, their response |
| The bystanders                        | What they saw and didn't address, not verifying               |
| The facilitators                      | The container, not intervening, lack of education             |

"Victim" is not a get-out-of-responsibility-free card.

Having been wronged doesn't mean you have nothing to look at.

### What "The Person Whose Boundary Was Crossed" Can Look At

If someone's boundary was crossed, they can take responsibility by asking:

- Did I properly vet this person before playing with them?
- Did I take the time to get to know them and trust them first?
- Did I check if they were safe, of clear mind, capable of the activity?
- Did I communicate my boundaries clearly beforehand?
- Did I [fawn](./fawning.md) instead of speaking up?
- What will I do differently next time to create a different outcome?

This isn't victim-blaming. It's recognizing: **You have power in who you choose to interact with and how.**

Next time, before playing with someone, you can make sure you actually know and trust them. That's taking responsibility.

## You're Responsible for Other People's Mistakes

This is counterintuitive. Most people don't see it. But it's one of the most important applications of responsibility:

**If someone else makes a mistake in a container you're in, you have responsibility for that mistake.**

Not because you did it. But because you were part of the system that allowed it.

### An Example That Makes It Click

Imagine a facilitator running a week-long retreat. They have a room full of people—many who've never been to a sex-positive space before. At the end of the week, there's an open temple night where people can play.

**Irresponsible approach:** "Okay everybody, go fuck each other, have fun!" No education. No teaching about fawning, boundaries, safer sex conversations. Just newbies fumbling into intimacy with no preparation.

What happens? Accidents. People feel bad. They don't know how to handle it. Blame spirals. Witch hunts.

**Responsible approach:** Spend the week teaching people how to have safer sex conversations, what fawning looks like, how to check in, what to watch for. Then open temple night, with everyone equipped to navigate it.

What happens? People feel safe, held, and have fun. When mistakes happen—and they will—people know how to handle them. Everyone wins.

Most people look at this and think: "Yeah, the facilitator has a duty to prepare people."

**Here's the part they miss: So do you.**

You're not a passive consumer of the container. You're a co-creator of it. You have power to influence what happens—whether you're staff or a first-time participant.

Ask yourself:

- Did I see warning signs and say nothing?
- Was I talking to this person and noticed something—trauma, a limiting belief, a pattern—that I thought might cause problems later?
- Did I let it be instead of trying to help?
- Could I have stood up before the event started and said something to the group?
- Could I have talked to the facilitators about what people should learn before playing?
- Could I have taken action to improve the container's safety?

The only difference between you and the facilitator is that the facilitator is expected to do these things. But nothing stops you from doing them too. And if you don't, you're responsible for that inaction—same as they would be.

### Examples of Taking Responsibility for Others' Mistakes

**Before the incident:**

- "Hey everyone, I've seen this pattern before. Can we talk about it so we all stay safe?"
- Talking to facilitators: "I think everyone should learn about fawning before we start playing."
- "Does anyone struggle with [X]? Come talk to me and I'll help."
- Noticing someone seems off and checking in with them privately

**After the incident:**

- "What did I see that I ignored?"
- "How could I have contributed to preventing this?"
- "What will I do differently in the next container?"

You don't have to be the one who made the mistake to be responsible for helping prevent it. You are a co-creator of the container—not a passive consumer of it.

## Responsibility ≠ Blame

This is critical to understand. **Responsibility and blame are opposites.**

| Blame                  | Responsibility               |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Backward-looking       | Forward-looking              |
| "You caused this"      | "How did I contribute?"      |
| "You're bad"           | "What can I do differently?" |
| Denies your own power  | Recognizes your power        |
| Disempowers the blamer | Empowers the responsible     |
| Creates victims        | Creates creators             |

### Why Blame Feels Good But Hurts You

When you blame someone, you get a hit of righteousness. It feels good. "I'm right, they're wrong. They're the problem, not me."

But here's what blame actually does:

**Blame gives your power away.**

When you say "You caused this," you're saying "You have the power here. I was just a passive recipient of your actions."

When you say "It's your fault," you're saying "I couldn't have done anything different. I had no control."

When you point the finger outward, you deny your own agency.

**The person you blame the most is the person you give the most power to.**

Think about it:

- If they caused it, they control it
- If they control it, only they can fix it
- If only they can fix it, you're helpless until they change

Blame feels like power. It's actually the opposite. It's a declaration of your own powerlessness.

### What Responsibility Gives You

When you take responsibility—even for things that weren't "your fault"—you're saying:

- I had power here
- I can see how I contributed
- I can do something different next time
- I'm not a victim of circumstance
- My future is in my hands

This is the [Creator](./drama-triangle.md) mindset. It's the opposite of [Victim](./drama-triangle.md).

## Why People Don't Take Responsibility

1. **They don't see their power** — If you don't recognize your control, you can't take responsibility for it
2. **They've been taught they're powerless** — Society often encourages victimhood over agency
3. **Trauma has convinced them the world happens TO them** — Their filters say they're not safe, not in control
4. **Taking responsibility feels like admitting fault** — They confuse responsibility with blame
5. **It's easier to point outward than look inward** — Self-examination is uncomfortable

### How to Help Someone Take Responsibility

Instead of lecturing someone on morality:

- Show them their own power
- Show them they can create a different outcome
- Once they see their power, responsibility follows naturally

People can't take responsibility for things they believe they have no control over. The key is helping them see their control.

## Omni-Responsible

You are responsible for everything in your life that you have the power to influence.

Not because you caused everything. But because you can influence it.

Even when someone else made the mistake, you can ask:

- How did I contribute to this situation?
- What could I have done differently?
- What will I do differently next time?

This isn't self-blame. It's self-empowerment.

But here's the deeper question: **How much power do you actually have?**

Most people dramatically underestimate their power. They think they're small, limited, capable of affecting only what's right in front of them. What if that's a lie your culture taught you?

## The Responsibility Mirror

Here's a term for an important check:

> **The Responsibility Mirror**: Before demanding responsibility from someone else, look in the mirror. Are you taking responsibility for your part?

When you're about to say "You need to take responsibility," ask yourself:

- Did I verify before judging? ([Before You Judge](./before-you-judge.md))
- Is my response proportional? ([Appropriate Response](./appropriate-response.md))
- Am I acting from Persecutor? ([Drama Triangle](./drama-triangle.md))
- Do I even know what happened?
- What's MY responsibility in this situation?
- Am I looking in the mirror, or only pointing outward?

**Responsibility is always a two-way street.**

If you're demanding it from someone else while refusing to examine your own role, you're not practicing responsibility—you're practicing blame.

### The Accusers Who Don't Take Responsibility

Watch for this pattern:

1. Something happens
2. A group forms to condemn someone
3. "You need to take responsibility!"
4. But the accusers aren't taking any themselves

They're pointing fingers while refusing to look at their own hands.

**Failing the Responsibility Mirror—demanding responsibility while taking none yourself—is hypocrisy.**

And often, the mob does more harm than the original incident.
