## How Feelings Actually Work

Most people believe their feelings are caused by what happens to them.

**This is false.**

Your feelings are caused by the **stories you tell yourself** about what happened.

└─────────────────┘      └─────────────────┘      └─────────────────┘
```

This concept comes from _Crucial Conversations_ and transforms how you understand emotional reactions—yours and others'.

### The Same Experience, Different Feelings

Consider death.

In our culture, death is treated as inherently tragic. We assume grief is the natural, unavoidable response to losing someone.

But in other cultures:

- Death is **joyous**—a celebration of the person's transition
- Death is **neutral**—just part of the cycle
- Children hold the severed limbs of deceased grandparents without distress

Same experience. Completely different feelings.

The difference isn't the death. It's the **story** about what death means.

### Any Feeling to Any Stimulus

This means something profound:

> **Humans can feel any emotion in response to any experience—because we can have any story in our heads.**

Someone touches you without asking:

- Story: "They're a predator testing my boundaries" → Fear, violation
- Story: "They're socially awkward and didn't know better" → Mild annoyance
- Story: "They felt connected to me and got carried away" → Compassion, maybe flattery

Same touch. Same person. Completely different emotional experiences—based entirely on the story.

### Why Knowing Doesn't Change Feeling

You might be thinking: "Okay, I understand intellectually that my feelings come from stories. So why can't I just change the story and feel differently?"

Here's the thing: **stories don't live in your intellect. They live in your body.**

They're stored in your subconscious, ingrained in your neurons, wired into automatic responses you didn't consciously choose. You can understand something intellectually and still feel the old way—because the story isn't running in the part of your brain that does understanding.

This is why you can't just think your way out of emotional patterns. The stories are so deep they're automatic. Often, you're not even aware when they're affecting you. You just feel the feeling and assume it's the natural response to reality.

**But here's the good news: it is possible to change.**

It takes time. It takes exposure to the situations where your old story gets activated—and consciously noticing that the story isn't true. It takes new data, new experiences that contradict the old pattern. It takes deliberate effort to construct a different story and reinforce it until it becomes the new automatic.

This is what healing looks like. Not flipping a switch, but gradually rewiring the deep patterns until your body tells a different story than it used to.

### The Story Happens Instantly

Here's the tricky part: **you don't notice the story.**

The experience happens. The feeling arrives. It seems like the experience _caused_ the feeling directly.

But there was a story in between. It happened so fast you didn't see it.

This is why two people can witness the exact same event and have completely opposite emotional reactions. They're not reacting to the event—they're reacting to their stories about the event.

## Stories Control Attention

Here's another layer: **stories don't just create feelings. They also direct attention.**

> **"We don't experience life. We experience the life we focus on."**  
> — Tony Robbins

Where you look determines what you see. And what you see determines the story you tell. And the story you tell determines how you feel.

### The Brown/Red Exercise

Here's an exercise that makes this visceral:

Look around the room for 10 seconds and count how many **brown** things you see. Go. Brown, brown, brown... count them all.

Done? Good. You have a number. You can probably remember most of the brown things you saw.

Now: **How many red things did you see?**

You don't know. You can't remember them. They all reached your eyeballs—you *saw* them—but you weren't paying attention to red. So they didn't register.

This is your **reticular activating system (RAS)**—a network in your brainstem that filters what you notice based on what you're looking for. Everything else fades into the background.

### The Horror Movie Effect

You know how after watching a horror film, you suddenly feel unsafe in your own home?

You're walking to the kitchen at night—something you've done a thousand times—and now every dark corner feels threatening. Every shadow could be a monster. You're looking over your shoulder.

Nothing changed about your house. It's exactly as safe as it's always been. What changed is your RAS. The movie primed you to look for threats. Now that's what your attention is scanning for—and you're finding them everywhere, even when they don't exist.

**This is what happens to people who enter intimate spaces primed for danger.**

If you walk into a temple or play party with your RAS set to "predator detection mode"—looking for threats, expecting harm, scanning for bad actors—you will find them. Every ambiguous touch becomes suspicious. Every awkward moment becomes evidence. Every mistake becomes confirmation.

Not because the threats are real. Because that's what you're looking for.

### Before You Enter a Space

Ask yourself honestly:

- **What is my attention primed for?** Am I expecting friends and fun? Or am I expecting predators and danger?
- **What will I see?** If someone makes a mistake, will I see an accident or an attack?
- **What filter am I bringing?** Do I assume people are on my side until proven otherwise? Or do I assume they're threats until proven safe?

If you're entering a space primed to see predators, you're more likely to over-respond to something that isn't actually a threat. [Notice, Feel, Story](../tools/notice-feel-story.md) is critical for you—because your first interpretation will almost certainly be "threat," and you need a way to check whether that's actually true.

### The Blind Men and the Elephant

You've probably heard the parable: several blind men encounter an elephant. One touches the trunk and says "It's a snake." One touches the leg and says "It's a tree." One touches the side and says "It's a wall."

They're all correct about what they observed. They're all wrong about the whole picture. Not because they're stupid or malicious—but because their attention was on different parts of the same thing.

**This is how attention works in conflict.**

Same event. Different attention. Completely different experience of what happened.

### Example: The Fawner's Two Experiences

Consider a [fawning](./fawning.md) situation. The same event occurred—someone said yes when they meant no, then felt violated afterward.

**If the fawner's attention is on:** "Something was done to me that I didn't want"
**They feel:** Violated, victimized, hurt

**If the fawner's attention is on:** "I lied to this person about my consent and then attacked them for believing me"
**They feel:** Guilt, responsibility, remorse

Same event. Same person. The only difference is where attention went. And that difference creates completely opposite emotional experiences—and completely different actions that follow.

### Fear Narrows Attention

Here's what makes this tricky: **strong emotions—especially fear—dramatically narrow attention.**

When you're afraid, your focus contracts. Your nervous system is looking for the threat. It's not taking in the whole picture. It's scanning for danger.

This means:

- A woman who feels afraid around men may genuinely not see his vulnerability
- A man who's been falsely accused may genuinely not see her fear
- A bystander caught up in mob energy may genuinely not see the accused person's humanity

**They're not being malicious. They're not choosing to ignore the other perspective.** Their fear is directing their attention to one part of the elephant, and they never even realized there was more to see.

This is why people can still cause harm even without intending to. They're just afraid. And fear makes the world look smaller than it is.

### When Accusations Occur

Here's what happens when someone makes a high-severity accusation—calling someone a predator, saying they were assaulted, demanding removal:

**Everyone's RAS shifts.**

Before the accusation, people were in "friends and fun" mode. Their attention was on connection, pleasure, the experience they came for. Every rustle in the bushes was assumed to be a friend.

After the accusation, everyone shifts to "threat detection" mode. A scary word was spoken. Now their reticular activating system is scanning for danger. Every rustle in the bushes is assumed to be a hungry wolf.

**And many of them will find a predator—even if one doesn't exist.**

Not consciously. They're not choosing to see threats. But everything they witness is now filtered through their activated RAS. Confirmation bias kicks in. Ambiguous behaviors that would have been ignored five minutes ago now become "evidence." The accused person's nervousness becomes proof of guilt. Their defense becomes manipulation. Their confusion becomes deception.

This is how witch hunts form. Not from evidence, but from collective attention shift. Once the word "predator" is spoken, everyone starts looking for predators—and the human brain is very good at finding what it's looking for.

**This is why [verification matters](./before-you-judge.md).** The first story isn't evidence. It's a trigger that changes what everyone is looking for. And what they find afterward is contaminated by what they were primed to see.

### The Invitation

When you notice yourself certain about what happened—certain about who's wrong, who's a threat, who's the victim—pause and ask:

- Where is my attention right now?
- What parts of this situation am I not seeing?
- What would someone with different fears focus on?
- Am I touching the trunk and calling it a snake?

### Don't Act From Fear

Here's a principle that will save you from regret:

**If you're acting from fear, pause.**

This isn't about telling you what to do. Whatever decision you're considering—that's your choice. But if you're making it while afraid, it's probably not going to lead to happiness or get you what you actually want. Fear contracts attention. Fear distorts perception. Fear makes everything look like a threat.

Decisions made from fear tend to be decisions you regret.

Wait until the fear subsides. Come back to it with a clear mind and well-adjusted feelings. Then decide. You might reach the same conclusion—but now it's a conclusion, not a reaction.

If you can't wait—if action is required immediately—at least acknowledge: *"I'm acting from fear right now. I might be wrong about what I'm seeing."* That acknowledgment alone creates a small gap between stimulus and response. And sometimes that gap is enough to prevent harm.

## Sex Is Politics

Here's something that explains why people are so bad at seeing clearly in these spaces:

**When a topic becomes political, people stop thinking.**

There's a [fascinating study](https://youtu.be/zB_OApdxcno?si=TdsW5Isfr8Jsw9QM) where researchers gave people a chart with numbers and asked them to draw conclusions. When the topic was neutral (like a skin cream's effectiveness), people with high numeracy skills got the right answers regardless of their beliefs.

But when the exact same numbers were presented in a political context (gun control), something changed. People stopped analyzing the data. They came with preconceived conclusions and worked backward to justify them. Even the smartest, most numerate people failed—because they weren't doing math anymore. They were defending their tribe.

**Sex is politics.**

Even if you've never been traumatized, even if you've never witnessed victimization firsthand, you've grown up in a culture that:

- Teaches you to fear potential predators everywhere
- Gives you strong preconceived notions about victims and perpetrators
- Programs you with "correct" opinions about how things should be handled
- Fills you with stories about the drama triangle before you ever encounter a real situation

When something happens in an intimate space, most people don't analyze what actually occurred. They don't look at the data. They come with preconceived conclusions and work backward.

They're not responding to reality. They're defending cultural programming.

This is why someone can witness a LOW severity accident and genuinely believe they saw a HIGH severity assault. They're not lying. They're not stupid. **They're operating from filters, not facts.**

And this is why the frameworks in this book matter. They give you a way to override the automatic political response and actually look at what happened.

## What Trauma Actually Is

Trauma is a **story stored in the body.**

It's not just a memory. It's a meaning-making pattern that runs automatically, below conscious awareness, telling you:

> "You are in danger. This is an emergency. Take action NOW."

When something in the present resembles something from the past—even vaguely—the trauma pattern activates. The body floods with stress hormones. The thinking brain goes offline. And one of four automatic responses takes over:

### The Four Trauma Responses

| Response   | What It Looks Like                       | The Story Running                 |
| ---------- | ---------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| **Fight**  | Aggression, pushing back, attacking      | "I must destroy the threat"       |
| **Flight** | Leaving, avoiding, running away          | "I must escape the threat"        |
| **Freeze** | Going still, shutting down, dissociating | "If I don't move, maybe it stops" |
| **Fawn**   | People-pleasing, agreeing, appeasing     | "If I make them happy, I'm safe"  |

None of these are conscious choices. They're automatic programs running from old stories.

### The Problem: Old Stories, New Situations

Trauma responses were adaptive once. They helped you survive something.

The problem is they keep running **even when the danger is gone.**

Someone makes an innocent mistake, and your body screams "PREDATOR!" Someone asks you a question, and you freeze. Someone expresses disappointment, and you fawn to make it okay.

The experience is new. But you're reacting to an old story.

### How Subtle Stories Create Real Problems

Here's what makes this tricky: **you might not even know your story exists.**

You can do years of healing work and still have a subtle lens you've never examined—a background hum of meaning-making that's so normal to you that you don't recognize it as a filter.

**Example: The "I'm Being Left Out" Lens**

Imagine someone with a deep, unexamined story: "I'm always being excluded."

They might not consciously think this. But their perception is subtly biased toward seeing exclusion everywhere:

- When two people whisper, they assume it's about them
- When someone gets attention they don't, they feel passed over
- When ambiguous situations arise, they interpret them as "everyone else is getting something I'm not"

Now put this person in a play space. They're tired. Their thinking brain is offline. And something ambiguous happens—maybe they see movement that could be interpreted multiple ways.

Their "exclusion" filter kicks in automatically:

> "They're doing something I'm not included in."

And from that interpretation—which may or may not be accurate—they take an action. An action they might not have taken if they'd seen the situation clearly.

**The mistake wasn't malicious.** They weren't trying to harm anyone. But their unconscious story distorted their perception, and their perception drove their behavior.

### Why This Matters

This is **exceedingly subtle.**

You don't normally think: "My tendency to feel excluded is affecting my actions right now." You just... see what you see. And act on what you see.

But what you see is filtered through stories you may have never examined.

In play spaces, where:

- Stakes are high
- Bodies are involved
- Consent depends on accurate perception
- You might be tired, altered, or emotionally activated

...these subtle filters can create real problems.

### Stories and the Problems They Create

| The Story                            | How It Distorts Perception                                                                         | The Mistake It Can Cause                                                                                       |
| ------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| "I'm always being left out"          | Sees exclusion everywhere; interprets ambiguous situations as "they're doing something without me" | Misreads what's happening, acts on false interpretation, creates boundary violations from confusion            |
| "Everyone wants what I have"         | Paranoid about partner; assumes every friendly interaction is someone trying to steal them         | Accuses innocent people of predatory behavior, creates conflict, drives partner away with jealousy             |
| "People always take advantage of me" | Sees manipulation in normal requests; assumes the worst intent                                     | Over-reacts to low-severity situations, shuts down connection, may launch [witch hunts](./before-you-judge.md) |
| "I'm not worthy of attention"        | Assumes rejection is coming; doesn't believe genuine interest                                      | [Fawns](./fawning.md) instead of setting boundaries, says yes when they mean no, gets hurt                     |
| "Men only want one thing"            | Interprets every touch as sexual; sees predatory intent in friendliness                            | Accuses someone of being "rapey" when they were just being warm, destroys reputations over nothing             |
| "I have to earn my place"            | Feels like they don't belong unless they're useful or pleasing                                     | Over-gives, burns out, resents others, [fawns](./fawning.md) to stay accepted                                  |
| "Facilitators are perfect"           | Expects staff to never make mistakes; sees any error as proof of predation                         | Over-responds to normal human error, starts witch hunts, destroys careers over accidents                       |
| "I would never do that"              | Can't imagine making certain mistakes; assumes anyone who does must be malicious                   | Blind to own risk (more likely to make that mistake), crucifies others for accidents they can't conceive of    |

**Example: "Everyone Wants What I Have"**

A couple comes to a play party together. One partner has an unexamined story: "Everyone wants what I have. People are always trying to take what's mine."

At the party, someone chats warmly with their partner. Just friendly conversation—nothing flirtatious.

But through the jealousy filter:

> "They're trying to steal my partner. I need to intervene."

They pull their partner away, act cold to the "threat," maybe even confront them later. The other person is confused and hurt—they were just being friendly.

The jealous partner might even go further: warning others that this person is "predatory," starting whispers, creating [high-severity](./severity.md) consequences for someone who did nothing wrong.

**Here's the problem: they genuinely believe their story.**

It's not that they're being irrational. Within their reference frame—where "everyone wants what I have" is a core axiom—their actions make perfect sense. If you truly believe others are trying to steal your partner, of course you'd act defensive. Of course you'd push people away. Of course you'd warn others about the "threat."

The harm they're creating feels like self-defense. They think they're responding to high-severity aggression against them—but it's not true at all.

> "All people's actions are sane and reasonable, given their beliefs about the world they are operating within."

This is why stories are so dangerous. The person acting from them isn't crazy. They're just operating from false premises they don't know are false.

**Example: "Facilitators Are Perfect"**

This one is especially common among newcomers to sex-positive spaces.

Someone attends their first retreat or play party. They see facilitators and staff who've been in this world for years. They see confidence, skill, experience. And they form a story:

> "These people know everything. They've seen everything. They don't make mistakes."

This is a myth. Facilitators are human. Staff are human. They make mistakes like everyone else—unconscious slips, moments of impairment, autopilot errors. Years of experience reduce mistakes; they don't eliminate them.

But if you're carrying the "facilitators are perfect" filter, here's what happens when a staff member makes a normal human mistake:

Your filter says: "Experienced people don't make mistakes. Therefore this wasn't a mistake. It was intentional. They're a predator using their position to take advantage of people."

Note: these words may never consciously go through your head. The belief that facilitators are perfect might be entirely subconscious—just part of how you see the world. The idea that facilitators are *not* perfect may not be something you've ever consciously considered, much less put into words.

So when something happens, it doesn't work like an inner monologue stepping through logic. You see a staff member make a mistake, and your reference frame—which literally does not allow for the possibility of innocent error from experienced people—produces only one interpretation: predator. You're not *concluding* they're a predator. You're *perceiving* it, because your filter doesn't offer any other option.

You skip right past accident to malice. You skip right past LOW to HIGH severity. Because in your reference frame, the only explanation for staff error is predation.

**The irony:** Facilitators and experienced staff are typically the *safest* people in the room. They've made their mistakes, learned from them, trained extensively, and developed refined awareness. They're the least likely to cause harm—and the most equipped to handle it well when they do.

But the "facilitators are perfect" filter inverts reality. When the safest person makes a minor slip, they're suddenly perceived as the biggest threat—because "someone that experienced wouldn't make a mistake unless they meant to."

The filter causes people to attack the lowest-risk participants while potentially overlooking actual risks from less experienced people who haven't yet learned what the veterans have.

It's the "meet your heroes and be disappointed" effect. The disappointment isn't because your heroes are secretly terrible—it's because they were never superhuman to begin with. The myth was yours, not theirs.

**This filter is why some containers don't allow facilitators or staff to play with participants.**

Not because facilitators are dangerous. Not because staff can't be trusted. But because:

1. **Participants project perfection onto them** — and perfection is impossible
2. **When mistakes inevitably happen, the filter amplifies them** — a LOW mistake from staff gets perceived as HIGH because "they should have known better"
3. **The perceived power dynamic intensifies the over-response** — "they used their position" when actually they just slipped like any human would
4. **Having a neutral party to hold space matters** — if the angry person is mad at the facilitator, who holds the container?

Some containers allow assistants to play but not lead facilitators. Same logic—the more authority someone appears to have, the more the perfection myth applies, the more dangerous the over-response when they inevitably prove human.

**The reality:**

Facilitators have seen more than you. They have more experience. They probably have more wisdom about these dynamics.

They are still human. They will still make mistakes. And when they do, the appropriate question is the same as for anyone: What [type of mistake](./types-of-mistakes.md) was it? What's the actual [severity](./severity.md)? Is your [response appropriate](./appropriate-response.md)?

Not: "How could someone experienced do this? They must be a predator."

If you catch yourself thinking that, you're in the filter. Check it.

**Example: "I Would Never Do That"**

This filter often compounds with "Facilitators are perfect"—and it's especially common in newcomers.

Someone new to these spaces hasn't read this book. They don't know about [unconscious mistakes](./types-of-mistakes.md#why-unconscious-mistakes-happen)—autopilot errors, impairment slips, hunger-driven moments where the conscious mind wasn't driving.

> **They've never learned that their own body can do things their conscious mind wouldn't choose.**

[Fawning](./fawning.md) is a perfect example. Someone says yes when they mean no—not because they chose to lie, but because their body produced the word before their conscious mind could intervene. Their mouth said yes while their mind was screaming no. If you've ever fawned, you already know what it's like for your body to act against your conscious will.

The same thing happens on the other side of the interaction. Someone's hand moves somewhere it shouldn't—not because they chose to violate a boundary, but because their autopilot fired before their conscious mind caught it.

If you understand fawning, you already have the reference frame to understand unconscious boundary crossings. They're the same mechanism pointing in different directions.

So when newcomers imagine a boundary violation, they can only imagine it as a choice. A conscious decision to harm someone. Because that's the only mechanism they know.

This creates a double problem:

**1. They're blind to their own risk.**

If you can't conceive of making an unconscious mistake, you won't take precautions against it. You won't learn the [Gun Test](../tools/gun-test.md). You won't train safety checks into your autopilot. You won't think "maybe I shouldn't play when I'm this tired."

The person who thinks "I would never do that" is often the person most likely to do exactly that—because they're not watching for it. They're the newbie with no trained safety mechanisms, walking into high-stakes situations with the confidence of someone who doesn't know what they don't know.

**2. They crucify others for mistakes they can't conceive of.**

When they see someone cross a boundary, they have no mental category for "unconscious accident." The only explanation their reference frame offers is: "They meant to do that. They're a predator."

They're not being malicious. They genuinely can't imagine another explanation. But the result is the same: they launch [HIGH severity responses](./severity.md) to LOW severity accidents, destroy reputations over moments of unconsciousness, and create witch hunts based on their own inability to conceive of how mistakes actually happen.

**The painful irony:**

The newcomer who thinks "I would never do that" is:
- More likely to make that exact mistake (because they're not guarding against it)
- More likely to destroy someone else for making it (because they can't conceive of innocence)
- The least qualified to judge what happened (because they don't understand the mechanisms)

Meanwhile, the veteran who HAS made that mistake and learned from it:
- Is less likely to make it again (because they've trained against it)
- Is more likely to recognize it as an accident when they see it (because they understand how it happens)
- Is more qualified to assess what actually occurred (because they have the reference frame)

The people who think they'd never make a mistake are the most dangerous—both to themselves and to everyone they might judge.

<!-- PENDING: "This pattern in action" example is in notes/pending-examples.md -->

**Example: "I'm Always Being Left Out"**

Someone with this story attends a group experience. They're tired. Something ambiguous happens—maybe they see movement they can't quite interpret, or they notice others connecting in ways they're not part of.

Their filter activates:

> "Everyone else is getting something. I'm being excluded again."

From that interpretation—which may be completely wrong—they start engaging with others in a way they think everyone else is already doing and welcoming. But they're not. What they thought they saw wasn't actually happening. Now they've suddenly started engaging in a way others don't want and find inappropriate.

The mistake wasn't malicious. They weren't trying to violate anyone. But the unconscious story distorted their perception, and their tired brain acted on the distortion.

To everyone else, it looks like a boundary violation out of nowhere. To them, they were just "joining in" with what they thought was already happening.

### When Filters Find Each Other

Here's something that makes this worse: **complementary filters magnetize.**

Consider someone whose subconscious runs this story: "People are going to misunderstand me and attack me."

They might not consciously think this. But their body knows it. Every time their phone buzzes—a text, a call, a notification—they get a jolt of fear. *Is someone mad at me? Did they see some imperfection and now they think I'm deserving to be screamed at?* 

They're not choosing to think this. Their nervous system just fires. Years of being misunderstood have trained their RAS to expect attack.

This story doesn't just distort perception. **It creates the thing it fears.**

Say they're on a team. They make a minor error—the kind everyone makes. But they hyper-focus on it: *Oh no, someone might misunderstand this.* So they proactively bring it up at the team meeting, trying to seem accountable.

The problem: everyone makes these mistakes, but no one else mentions theirs. Now this person is the only one the team hears making errors. Week after week. Their confessions are training everyone else's RAS: *This person is mistake-prone. Watch them.*

They think they're being responsible. They're actually painting a target on themselves.

**And then comes the fawning.**

When someone does confront them—angry, accusing—their fear kicks in. Part of the fear is the story: *I don't know how to handle this. If I defend myself, it'll get worse.*

So instead of saying "This is unreasonable. You can't speak to me this way. If you want to talk with dignity and respect, I'm available—otherwise, I'm not"—instead of that, they try to appease. They explain their actions, which to the attacker looks like manipulation, trying to get out of trouble. The attack intensifies.

They apologize—not because they did anything wrong, but because apologizing makes angry people less angry. Fawning.

But to the attacker, the apology looks like a confession. It reinforces the attacker's story: *See? They admitted it. I was right.*

**The person never showed any other possibility.** They never took action that would make the attacker question what they were seeing. Their fear of being misunderstood and attacked caused them to take exactly the actions that caused people to misunderstand and attack them.

---

Now put these two people in the same room:

- **Person A:** RAS primed for predators. "They're everywhere. I need to find them."
- **Person B:** RAS primed for attack. "People will misunderstand me and explode."

You don't have to consciously put them together. They're like magnets. They'll find each other.

Person A is scanning for threats. Person B is anxious, apologetic, constantly flagging their own mistakes—which looks suspicious to someone hunting predators. Person A confronts. Person B fawns and explains—which looks like manipulation. Person A escalates. Person B apologizes for things they didn't do—which confirms Person A's story.

This happens like magic. Neither intended it. But their reticular activating systems were looking for something with polarity—and they found each other.

**The painful irony:**

> The people most afraid that predators are everywhere are most likely to see and attack false predators.
>
> The people most afraid of being misunderstood and attacked are most likely to wind up being attacked.

Both feel like victims. Both think the other person proved their story right. Neither realizes they co-created the dynamic from complementary fears.

**The way out:**

If either one chilled the fuck out, the dynamic dissolves.

If Person A relaxed and said, "I'm in a safe place. I don't need to scan for predators every second"—they'd stop seeing threats in anxious people.

If Person B relaxed and stopped looking for signs they're about to be attacked—they'd stop taking the defensive actions that look suspicious.

If their reticular activating systems focused on literally anything else, both would be less likely to find what they're expecting to find. They might even find their patterns funny. They might even be friends.

### The Invitation

This isn't about being paranoid about your every perception.

It's about humility:

> "I might have stories I don't know about. My interpretation might not be accurate. Before I act—especially on something significant—let me check."

This is why [Notice, Feel, Story](../tools/notice-feel-story.md) and [Before You Judge](./before-you-judge.md) matter so much. They're tools for catching your filters before they cause harm.

## The Problem in Sex-Positive Spaces

When a boundary violation occurs, what do you assume about the person who made it?

- Do you assume the best or the worst?
- What meaning do you ascribe to mistakes?
- Do you know you have trauma that causes your interpretations to lean a certain way?

### How Trauma Distorts Everything

Trauma creates subconscious filters. You may not even know you have trauma. It may just be one of those filters you view the world through.

**A belief and narrative about the world and what happened to you.**

Whatever comes up—whatever mistake someone makes, you make it, they make it—you're going to view everything through your beliefs and filters, **which are not necessarily real.**

Someone's hand brushes your thigh:

- Without trauma filter: "That was probably accidental. I'll mention my boundary if it happens again."
- With trauma filter: "They're testing me. This is how it starts. I need to protect myself."

Both interpretations create very different [appropriate responses](./appropriate-response.md).

One leads to a simple conversation. The other might lead to accusations, witch hunts, or [high-severity](./severity.md) responses to a low-severity mistake.

## Limiting Beliefs & Primary Questions

(Concept from Tony Robbins' Date with Destiny)

There may be a single sentence running your life and tainting how you see everything in the world.

Examples:

- "People always hurt me"
- "I'm not safe"
- "Men/women can't be trusted"
- "I have to protect myself at all costs"
- "If I let my guard down, I'll be taken advantage of"
- "People only want one thing from me"

These aren't conscious beliefs you chose. They were installed by experiences—often in childhood—and they run automatically.

These filters will distort:

- How you interpret others' [types of mistakes](./types-of-mistakes.md)
- How you assess [severity](./severity.md)
- Whether your [response is appropriate](./appropriate-response.md)
- Whether you see someone as a predator or a person who made a mistake

## Checking Your Stories

The good news: once you understand that feelings come from stories, you can **check your stories.**

Before you react, pause and ask:

1. **What happened?** (Just the facts—what a camera would have recorded)
2. **What story am I telling myself about it?**
3. **Is that story definitely true, or is it an assumption?**
4. **What other stories could explain what happened?**

This is the core of the [Notice, Feel, Story](../tools/notice-feel-story.md) tool—a practical technique for separating experience from interpretation.

### Example

**Experience:** He touched my lower back without asking.

**My story:** He's testing my boundaries to see what he can get away with. This is predatory behavior.

**Possible alternative stories:**

- He's affectionate and thought we had a connection
- In his culture, that touch is normal and friendly
- He wasn't thinking and did it automatically
- He genuinely didn't know I'd mind

**What would help:** Asking him directly. Using [Notice, Feel, Story](../tools/notice-feel-story.md) to check instead of assuming.

## Responsibility When You Have Trauma

Having trauma is **not your fault.**

How you handle it when interacting with others **is your responsibility.**

This isn't blame. It's [empowerment](./responsibility.md). You're the only one who can:

- Know your triggers
- Communicate them when possible
- Pause before reacting
- Ask: "Is this about NOW or about THEN?"
- Check your stories before acting on them
- Take [100% control](../tools/100-percent-control.md) of your safety

### The Hard Truth

Your trauma responses can harm others.

If your body screams "PREDATOR!" and you act on that—spreading warnings, starting witch hunts, destroying someone's reputation—you may be creating [high-severity](./severity.md) harm to someone who made an innocent mistake.

Your fear felt real. Your story felt true. But the consequences you created are still your responsibility.

This isn't fair. You didn't ask for trauma. But the people you harm didn't ask for your trauma responses either.

### The Path Forward

Healing isn't about suppressing your responses. It's about:

1. **Recognizing** when you're reacting to old stories
2. **Pausing** before taking action
3. **Checking** your story with the people involved
4. **Choosing** your response consciously instead of automatically

Over time, with practice and often with support, the old stories lose their grip. The gap between trigger and response grows longer. You gain the ability to feel the fear without acting from it.

This is what it means to take responsibility for your trauma while also having compassion for yourself.
