## What Is Fawning?

Fawning is a trauma response where someone says "yes" when they mean "no."

It's one of the four trauma responses:

- **Fight** — aggression, pushing back
- **Flight** — leaving, avoiding
- **Freeze** — going still, shutting down
- **Fawn** — people-pleasing, agreeing to avoid conflict

## The Two Victims Problem

**When fawning happens, it creates TWO victims.**

See: [Fawning Diagram](../charts/fawning-diagram.md)

```
Person A: Asks/initiates
Person B: Fawns (says yes, means no)

RESULT: Two victims
```

### Person B (the fawner) is victimized by:

- Their own trauma response
- An experience they didn't actually want

### Person A (the initiator) is victimized by:

- False information (thought consent was real)
- Potential future accusation
- Being made into a "perpetrator" unknowingly
- Loss of ability to act with integrity
- **Their own consent was violated** — they never agreed to touch someone who didn't want it

That last point matters. Person A didn't consent to non-consensual touch. They thought they were engaging in mutual, enthusiastic activity. They weren't—and finding that out later feels icky, violating, wrong.

Person A may feel:

- "I touched someone who didn't want it—that's not who I am"
- "I would never have done that if I'd known"
- "I feel gross about something I did in good faith"

This is real harm. Person B's fawning created it.

## Responsibility

Person A still has responsibility to check in and read cues. If they sense something off—hesitation, flatness, a "yes" that doesn't feel enthusiastic—their job is to pause and ask:

> "I hear you saying yes, but I'm feeling something else. Are you really a yes? What's going on?"

If they don't catch it, they're still responsible for not catching it. But they're also a victim of being lied to and doing something they never would have consented to do.

| Person   | Responsibility                                                   |
| -------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Person A | Check in, read cues, create safety for honesty                   |
| Person B | Own the fawn, communicate after, don't blame A for believing you |

## Why This Matters

The culture often only sees Person B as the victim.

Your framework helps people see the full picture:

- Fawning harms both parties
- The fawner has [responsibility](./responsibility.md) too
- Person A cannot consent to something they didn't know was happening

## Teaching This

This is delicate. You're not blaming trauma survivors.

You're saying: **Your trauma response has consequences for others, and recognizing that is part of healing and taking your power back.**
