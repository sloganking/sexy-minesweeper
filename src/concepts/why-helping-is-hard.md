# Why Helping Is Hard

← [Back to Introduction](../introduction.md)

---

You understand [responsibility](./responsibility.md). You see how it gives people power. You watch someone suffer in a loop they can't escape—same conflict, same pattern, same pain—and you want to help them see what you see.

Here's the problem: **helping is hard.** Not because you lack the insight. Because the person you're trying to help often can't receive it.

## The Filter Behind It All

We talked about [trauma and filters](./trauma-and-filters.md)—the stories that shape how we perceive everything. This page is about one of the most widespread cultural filters there is:

**"People are inherently selfish."**

This belief is so pervasive, so destructive, and causes so many misunderstandings that it deserves its own page. It's not just one example among many. It's a filter that poisons countless interactions between people who are genuinely trying to help each other.

## Humans Are Suspicious of Selflessness

When someone offers genuine help, the recipient often can't compute it.

"What do you want from me? Where's the catch?"

Their filter cycles through: *If they're not selfishly trying to sell me something, they must be selfishly trying to get out of something—like accountability.* There *must* be a selfish angle somewhere.

Your benevolent intent gets interpreted as hidden manipulation. You're trying to help them see their power, so they can end their suffering—and they hear you saying it's their fault. You're trying to free them from a loop—and they think you're dodging accountability.

This is why so many misunderstandings happen. This is why people cry wolf when there are no wolves. They can't conceive of selflessness, so they interpret it as disguised selfishness.

### The Inversion Most People Miss

Most people assume being selfish is easy and being selfless takes strength. It's the opposite.

People sacrifice themselves in a thousand ways every day. Serving is comfortable. Receiving is hard. Standing up for yourself—[honoring the self](./facilitator-protocols.md#this-is-the-hardest-lesson)—is the ultimate act of courage.

But because the cultural story says humans are selfish, anyone who *appears* selfless must be hiding something. And anyone trying to help you see your own power must be trying to get out of theirs.

## Why You'd Want to Help Anyway

Because if someone doesn't see their power now, they're going to keep suffering.

Every future relationship. Every recurring pattern. The same pain, over and over. Helping them wake up to their responsibility isn't about making them feel bad—it's about freeing them from a loop they can't escape while they're blind to it.

You're not doing this to win an argument. You're doing it because you've seen what happens when people stay stuck. And you don't want that for them.

## Why It Often Backfires

### They Can't Hear You When They're Activated

Once someone is emotionally charged—stuck in their automatic perception of victimhood, powerlessness and blame—they can't hear you. Everything you say gets filtered through "you're attacking me."

This is why timing matters. It's best to help people see their power *before* something goes wrong. After the incident, they're activated. They'll interpret benevolent intent as attack.

**If you're reading this page:** odds are something has already happened. You've woken up to your own responsibility and power, and now you want to help someone else see theirs—but you're reading this *because* something went wrong and now you're learning about these dynamics.

That's why most of this book is written around the assumption that a mistake has already occurred. The easy case—nothing's wrong between you, no one's charged—is simple: "Hey, I found this book that I think is really valuable. Want to read it?" They spend a few hours with it and absorb the same communication. Showing is easy when nothing's on fire.

But you're probably here because something's on fire.

### Telling Doesn't Work

You can't just tell people they have power and expect them to believe you. Even with the best intentions. They may respond with an energetic *fuck you, I don't have power here, this is all your fault!*

Telling bounces off.

Telling someone "you have more power than you think" is an arguable statement. It doesn't prove itself. Whether it's true would be an entirely separate discussion.

**Showing is different.** Showing is irrefutable. It's waking someone up to something they didn't see before. The truth was always there—you're just bringing their attention to it.

Often you don't even need to tell people deep truths. You just show them. Telling may not be useful at all, because telling does nothing that showing wouldn't do better. Telling only helps them put it into words *after* they've already been shown.

**But showing takes time.** That's the catch. I can tell you "you have more power than you think" in a single sentence—and it won't actually communicate anything. It's just an arguable statement we collectively don't know is true or false.

Showing you—which is so much more powerful and actually constitutes real communication—takes time. And if something's already happened and they don't trust you, or they're emotionally charged, they won't give you that time. They'll interrupt. They'll protest. You can only tell them the short-form single sentence truth that bounces off, because they're not open to being shown.

### Sometimes What Looks Like Victim-Blaming Is Actually Someone Trying to Help

If someone doesn't see their power, they may interpret your attempt to show them as manipulation—as you trying to dodge accountability.

This can happen even when you've already taken full responsibility. You're not deflecting; you're trying to help them see how they can end their own suffering. But because their frame is "I'm the victim, you're the perpetrator," any suggestion that they had power sounds like blame-shifting.

### Talk For, Not About

Here's a technique that sidesteps the blame trap entirely.

When you look at a situation with "responsible eyes," you start seeing all the ways you created the outcome—and as a side effect you start seeing all the ways *they* created it too. You see their power even when they don't. And you might want to tell them, so they can create the outcomes they desire in the future.

But if you just walk up and say "here's all the things you could have done differently," it sounds like blame. It sounds like you're deflecting accountability. It's not well-received.

**The fix: talk *for* instead of *about*.**

**Talking about** is describing what went wrong:
> "You went ahead and spent money without checking in with me first. I know we talked about it being a potential interest, but you committed before you fully verified with me."

This is backward-looking. It analyzes fault. It invites defensiveness.

**Talking for** is making a clear request for the future:
> "Next time there's a moment where you're about to spend resources or commit to something—right before that happens—I want you to explicitly reach out and ask: 'I know we talked about this. My understanding is you're positive. Can I go ahead and commit now?'"

Every sentence spent "talking for" is actively solving the problem. You're not analyzing what went wrong. You're just making a request that, if they agree, fixes it.

**The beauty of this:**
- There's nothing to defend against—it's just a request
- If they say yes, the problem is solved
- You get what you actually want (different future behavior) instead of what you don't want (a fight about the past)

**And here's the deeper layer:** This is showing instead of telling.

You didn't tell them "you have power" or "you control 100% of the outcome." You didn't use any responsibility language at all. But by making a request for their future behavior, you demonstrated that they can create a different outcome. If they agree and follow through, they *experience* their power directly.

They learn their agency without ever having to be told they have it. The request itself shows them.

## The Limits

### Don't Be a Rescuer

If they're so resistant that your attempts are causing them pain, back off. You're not saving them under any cost. You're offering something. If they can't receive it, that's information—not a mandate to push harder.

See: [Drama Triangle — Rescuer](./drama-triangle.md)

### You Can't Force Awakening

People can't take responsibility for things they believe they have no control over. Once they *see* their power, responsibility follows naturally.

But you can't force that seeing. You can only offer conditions where it might happen—and respect when it doesn't.
