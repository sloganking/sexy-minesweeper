## The Safety Contract

One of the most powerful things a facilitator can do is establish clear rules at the beginning of a container—and make an explicit promise:

> **As long as you follow these rules, you are safe. You will not be kicked out. You will not be punished. You have room to experiment, make mistakes, and learn. I have your back.**

This concept comes from high-performance environments (like Sandler sales training): when people know exactly what the boundaries are, and know they're protected as long as they stay within them, they can relax. They can take risks. They can fail and learn without fear.

### Why This Matters

Without clear rules, participants are anxious:

- "What if I do something wrong?"
- "What if someone gets upset with me?"
- "What if I make a mistake and get kicked out?"
- "What counts as 'too far'?"

This anxiety creates fawning, over-caution, and inauthentic participation. People can't fully show up if they're afraid of invisible tripwires.

With clear rules, participants feel contained:

- "I know what's expected of me"
- "I know what will get me in trouble"
- "I know that mistakes are okay"
- "I know the facilitator has my back if I'm operating in good faith"

### Suggested Guidelines

Here's a starter set of rules you might adapt for your container:

**You are safe as long as you:**

1. **Operate in good faith** — You're trying to do right by others, even when you make mistakes
2. **Communicate honestly** — You don't deliberately deceive or manipulate
3. **Respect stated boundaries** — When someone says no or stop, you stop
4. **Check in when uncertain** — If you're not sure, you ask
5. **Take responsibility for your mistakes** — When something goes wrong, you own your part
6. **Treat others with dignity** — Even in conflict, you don't attack character or threaten

**Mistakes are expected and okay:**

- Accidental boundary crossings (unconscious, unintentional)
- Miscommunications
- Getting triggered and needing to step away
- Trying something that doesn't work
- Not knowing something you "should" know

**These will result in being asked to leave:**

1. **Threats or acts of physical violence** — Verbal, physical, or implied. This includes intimidation through body language—walking up to someone aggressively, getting in their face, making them fear you might assault them. You don't have to say "I will punch you" for it to count. Interpretation is up to the facilitators and is not up for debate. Non-negotiable. (See: [Threats of Violence Must Be Stopped Immediately](#threats-of-violence-must-be-stopped-immediately))
2. **Intentional malice** — Deliberately trying to harm someone. If you're intentionally malicious, you're out. Not because of judgment, but because we can't risk escalation.
3. **Repeated boundary violations after being told** — One mistake is human. Continued violation after clear communication is a pattern.
4. **Using victim status as an excuse to attack** — Whether it's your own victimhood or someone else's you're "protecting," victim status is not a license to attack. Defense is acceptable; aggression disguised as defense is not. (See: [Power Dynamics](./power-dynamics.md))
5. **Character assassination and triangulation** — Overt attempts to destroy someone's reputation or mobilize others against them. If you're trying to get people to gang up on someone rather than resolving the issue directly, you've crossed from defense into aggression.

### Defense vs. Aggression

When something goes wrong—a boundary violation, an unwanted touch, a miscommunication—you have rights:

**Defensive actions are always acceptable:**

- Removing yourself from the situation
- Separating someone you care about from harm
- Saying "stop" or "no" firmly
- Having strong emotions
- Taking space to process
- Reporting to facilitators

These are protective. They create safety.

**Aggressive actions are not acceptable:**

- Using the incident as an excuse to publicly attack their character
- Mobilizing others against them before verification
- Responding to a MEDIUM severity infraction with HIGH severity action—that's attack, not defense
- Calling your aggression "defense" when you're really indulging your anger

Here's the key: **Defense protects. Aggression punishes.**

### Your Rights Regarding Removal

**You DO have the right to:**

- Ask the facilitators to enforce our stated agreements
- Request that we review whether someone has violated a removal-worthy rule
- Expect us to act if someone has genuinely crossed those lines

In fact, we welcome it. We invite you to help us walk our talk and maintain our integrity. If you see us failing to uphold our own agreements, tell us. Be an ally in keeping this container safe. We want that partnership.

**You do NOT have the right to:**

- Demand that someone leave if they haven't violated the stated rules
- Pressure facilitators to remove someone based on your anger rather than the agreements
- Treat your emotional reaction as equivalent to a rule violation

If your primary goal is to make sure you and others are safe, you're in defense. If your primary goal is to make the other person pay, you're in aggression—even if you're calling it "holding them accountable."

When you're activated and angry, it's easy to blur this line. That's why we name it upfront: strong emotions are welcome, defensive actions are protected, but using an incident as license to attack will not be tolerated.

### The Key Distinction

**Mistakes made in good faith** → Protected. Work through it. Learn. Stay.

**Intentional harm or repeated violations** → Not protected. Asked to leave.

This isn't about being harsh. It's about being clear. When people know exactly where the lines are, they can relax inside them.

### Why This Benefits You (The Facilitator)

These rules aren't just for participants. They're for you.

**Clarity on when to act:** When you've clearly stated what will result in removal, you don't have to agonize over decisions in the moment. Someone threatens violence? You already said that's grounds for removal. Done. No second-guessing.

**Accountability to your own values:** Writing it down and sharing it publicly keeps you honest. If you say "threats of violence result in removal" but then let it slide because you're scared of the person, a participant can point to your own rules and help you walk your talk.

**A reference when you're unsure:** In the heat of a situation, you can ask yourself: "Did they violate one of my stated rules?" If yes, act. If no, work through it. The list becomes your decision-making framework.

**Protection from accusations of targeting:** When everyone knows the rules upfront, your enforcement looks like consistency, not personal vendetta.

### Communicate This Early

This should be communicated at the very beginning of your container—before anything happens. Not after someone makes a mistake. Not as a reaction to conflict.

When it's established upfront, it's a framework for safety. When it's announced mid-conflict, it looks like targeting.

### Example: How to Present This

Here's language you might use at the opening of your container:

> "Before we begin, I want to make a sacred promise to you.
>
> This promise is the foundation everything else rests on. It's the prime directive of this container. Every decision I make as your facilitator will orient around it.
>
> **Here is my promise:**
>
> **As long as you operate in good faith—communicating honestly, respecting stated boundaries, checking in when uncertain, and treating others with dignity—you are safe here. I have your back.**
>
> You can make mistakes. You can try things that don't work. You can get triggered and need to step away. You can not know things you 'should' know. None of that will get you removed. You are protected.
>
> **There are five things that will break this protection:**
>
> 1. Threats or acts of physical violence—verbal, physical, or implied through body language. Interpretation is up to me, not up for debate.
> 2. Intentional malice—deliberately trying to harm someone
> 3. Repeated boundary violations after being told to stop
> 4. Using victim status as an excuse to attack—yours or someone else's. Victim status is not a license to attack.
> 5. Character assassination or triangulation—trying to destroy someone's reputation or get others to gang up on them
>
> If you cross these lines, I cannot guarantee your place here.
>
> **One exception:** In rare cases, I may need to ask someone to leave—or to step out temporarily—for emergency safety reasons, even if they haven't broken these rules. This isn't punishment; it's protection. If I ever need to do this, I'll explain why, and it won't affect your standing in future events. This exception exists for genuine emergencies—not as a loophole for arbitrary removal.
>
> **One more thing:** If something goes wrong—if someone crosses a boundary—you have every right to strong emotions. You have every right to remove yourself, protect yourself, and report to us. These are defensive actions and they're always acceptable.
>
> What's not acceptable is using an incident as an excuse to attack. If your response shifts from protecting yourself to punishing someone else—public attacks, mobilizing others, demanding removal based on anger—that's aggression, not defense. Even if you're angry, even if the incident was real.
>
> **This is my promise. This is my commitment. This is the ground we stand on.**
>
> Inside these lines, you are safe. Outside them, you are not. Know where they are, and you can relax inside them."

You can adapt this language to your style. The key is: **say it early, say it clearly, and put it in writing if possible.**

## The Core Principle: Walk Your Talk

Nothing matters more for a facilitator than alignment between what you say and what you do.

You can teach about consent, boundaries, and dignity all day. But what people learn is what they see you do when it's hard.

**Show, don't tell.**

If you say everyone deserves dignity and respect, but you let someone treat you like shit because you're scared of them—you've just taught everyone that dignity is negotiable when someone gets angry enough.

If you say mistakes don't require leaving the container, but you kick someone out because an angry participant scared you into it—you've just taught everyone that mob pressure wins.

Your actions are louder than your words. Every time.

---

## Your First Officer

> **"Every good captain needs a first officer who will tell him when he's wrong."**  
> — _Star Trek: Strange New Worlds_ ([clip](https://photos.app.goo.gl/B8xWSpnxTAubvVi78))

As a facilitator, you need people around you who will tell you when you're wrong.

Not yes-men who agree with everything you say. Not people who are afraid to challenge you. You need co-facilitators, assistants, or trusted participants who:

- Have sound judgment you trust
- Will speak up when they see you making a mistake
- Can do it respectfully, without undermining your authority
- Will defer to your final decision even if they disagree

**This is extremely important.** You're human. You have blind spots. You'll make calls in the heat of the moment that aren't right. You need someone who can say: "Hey, I think you might be off here. Have you considered...?"

### How to Find Your First Officer

Look for people who:

- Have wisdom from lived experience (not just opinions)
- Can disagree without being disagreeable
- Understand the difference between input and authority
- Will support your decision publicly even if they challenged it privately

### For Participants: You May Be That Person

If you've been through significant experiences, introspected deeply, and gained real wisdom—you may have perspective that even experienced facilitators lack.

Don't assume they've seen everything. They haven't. Your experience and insight can guide them toward better outcomes. Offer it respectfully. You're not just a participant—you're a potential resource.

See: [You Become the Clearest Judge](./i-made-a-mistake.md#you-become-the-clearest-judge)

## Everyone Deserves Dignity and Respect

### The Puja Principle

In tantra, there's a ritual called the puja—a practice of worshipping each other as gods and goddesses. The idea is to see the divine in each other and yourself.

For many people, this is the first time they've ever been treated with such reverence, appreciation, and dignity. It's profound. It's awakening. And afterward, many decide:

> "This is how I want to be treated for the rest of my life. I'm going to have boundaries and only allow people into my life who treat me as divine."

This isn't arrogance. It's self-worth.

### The Principle to Carry

We're all powerful creators, even if we don't recognize it yet. We're all valuable. We're all worth being treated with dignity and respect.

**None of us should be treated like crap.**

This isn't just a nice idea. It's a core value that should govern how you run your container—and how you allow yourself to be treated within it.

---

## When Someone Attacks You

Here's where it gets hard.

Someone is angry. They're doing character assassination. They're calling you names—predator, abuser, whatever. They're playing victim loudly. They might be threatening your reputation.

Make no mistake: **they are abusing their power as a victim.**

The temptation—especially for facilitators and staff—is to fawn. To appease. To let them treat you badly because:

- "Facilitators are supposed to stay calm"
- "I don't want to escalate"
- "They might write hate mail"
- "Maybe I deserve this"

**This is wrong.**

### The Appropriate Response

If someone is speaking to you without dignity and respect, you don't fawn. You set a boundary.

**For participants and assistants:**

> "I can see you're angry, and I'm open to having a conversation about what happened. But I'm not available for being spoken to this way. Until you're willing to speak to me with dignity and respect, you're going to have to handle your emotions on your own."

Then disengage. You don't owe them your presence while they attack you.

If you're at a retreat and can't leave, talk to the facilitators. Set a boundary that this person doesn't interact with you unless they can treat you with dignity and respect.

**For staff:**

The same applies. Being staff doesn't mean you forfeit your right to be treated with respect.

If you model "staff don't defend themselves," you're teaching participants that they can treat you like shit and nothing will happen. You're showing that your values are negotiable.

That's not the lesson you want to teach.

### What You're Modeling

When you set a boundary with someone who's attacking you, you model:

- Self-respect is non-negotiable
- Dignity applies to everyone—including the accused
- Anger doesn't grant permission to abuse
- Values hold even when things get hard

When you fawn and appease, you model:

- Anger wins
- If you're loud enough, you get your way
- Facilitators/staff are afraid of participants
- The person crying victim controls the container

**Which lesson do you want participants to learn?**

---

## The Facilitator's Dilemma

Lead facilitators face a unique challenge.

You're responsible for the container. You're supposed to hold space for everyone. You're supposed to stay calm. There's an expectation that you'll be the adult in the room.

But that doesn't mean you accept abuse.

_[Section in development: How lead facilitators should respond when being attacked. The principle is clear—you don't take it—but the specific approach needs refinement.]_

---

## Threats of Violence Must Be Stopped Immediately

This is non-negotiable.

If a participant is making threats of physical violence—whether verbal ("I'll hurt you") or through physical intimidation (getting in someone's face, implying "if you disagree with me, I will assault you")—you must handle it immediately.

Not after the sharing circle. Not when things calm down. **Immediately.**

### Why Immediate Action Is Critical

Here's what happens if you don't act:

**Scenario:** A participant gets angry. They storm up to someone who disagreed with them, getting within inches of their face. Their body language screams violence. A facilitator eventually steps in—but everyone saw that if they'd decided to throw a punch, the facilitators probably wouldn't have stopped them in time.

**What you just showed everyone:**

- If you upset the angry person, we won't actually protect you
- Threats of violence are tolerated in this container
- The angry person has more power than the facilitators
- Your safety depends on not disagreeing with aggressive people

**What happens next:**

The container is no longer valid. People don't feel safe. Every share from that point forward is filtered through fear. The sharing circles aren't real shares anymore—they're performances designed to not upset the person who might hurt them.

You've lost the container. The angry person is now running your event.

### The Standard

Someone who creates a source of unsafety for other participants, staff, or facilitators must be:

1. **Given an immediate, clear boundary**: "You cannot threaten people here. If you continue, you will need to leave."
2. **Removed if they continue**: Not tomorrow. Not after they calm down. Now.

You cannot let someone making threats of violence—whether implied or explicit, whether "just" intimidation or actual death threats—stay in your environment.

If you do, you are:

- Allowing them to run your container
- Showing everyone that fear wins
- Demonstrating that your boundaries are negotiable
- Creating an environment where no one feels protected

### This Is Not Optional

Some facilitators think: "But they're activated. They're just scared. They don't mean it. I should hold space for them."

No.

Holding space does not mean tolerating threats of violence against other participants. Their activation is their responsibility. Your responsibility is the safety of everyone else in the container.

You can have compassion for someone's pain AND remove them from the space. These are not mutually exclusive.

### What You're Showing

| If You Act Immediately       | If You Hesitate or Don't Act           |
| ---------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| "We will protect you"        | "We can't protect you"                 |
| "Threats aren't tolerated"   | "Threats are tolerated if loud enough" |
| "The container is safe"      | "The container is not safe"            |
| "Facilitators are in charge" | "The angriest person is in charge"     |

Your actions in this moment define whether your container is real or theater.

---

## The Emergency Exception

The promise says participants are protected as long as they follow the rules. But there are rare situations where a facilitator must act before rules are broken—or must remove someone who isn't the one breaking them.

**This is not a loophole.** It's acknowledgment that safety sometimes requires action that doesn't fit neatly into the framework.

### When This Applies

**Imminent danger that hasn't crystallized into rule-breaking yet:**

Someone is escalating. They haven't made an explicit threat, but their energy is volatile. They're dissociating in a way that feels dangerous. They seem like they might hurt themselves or someone else. Your gut is screaming that something is very wrong.

You don't have to wait for them to actually break a rule before acting. Your job is to keep the container safe—not to be a courtroom that requires proof before intervening.

**Tactical removal for someone's protection:**

Person A is making threats. Ideally, Person A leaves. But what if you're genuinely concerned that asking them to leave will trigger violence right now, in this room?

In that case, you might need to get Person B—the potential victim—out first. Not because they did anything wrong, but because their immediate physical safety matters more than the principle of "the rule-breaker should leave first."

Once Person B is safe, you handle Person A.

**Example:**

> A participant is becoming increasingly agitated. They're pacing, clenching fists, muttering. They haven't threatened anyone yet, but you've worked with enough activated people to know this is heading somewhere bad. Another participant—the one they're focused on—looks frozen.
>
> You quietly approach the frozen participant: "Hey, let's step outside for a minute." You get them out of the room. Then you return to address the agitated person, now without a target present and without an audience that might escalate things further.
>
> The frozen participant wasn't being punished. They were being protected. You explain this to them afterward.

**Example:**

> Someone arrives at your event and something feels deeply off. They haven't broken any rules. They're technically following the agreements. But something in their eyes, their affect, their energy—you can't name it, but every instinct says this person is not okay to have in this container.
>
> You pull them aside: "Hey, I'm noticing you seem like you might be going through something intense right now. I don't think this event is the right place for you today. I'd like to talk about rescheduling for another time."
>
> You're not accusing them of anything. You're not punishing them. You're making a judgment call that this container cannot safely hold whatever they're carrying right now.

### What This Is NOT

This exception is **not** permission to:

- Remove someone because you don't like them
- Remove someone because another participant is angry at them
- Remove someone because their presence makes people uncomfortable (discomfort isn't danger)
- Remove someone because you're scared of how it will look if you don't
- Remove someone for breaking social norms rather than safety concerns

The emergency exception is for genuine safety emergencies—situations where waiting for a clear rule violation would put people at unacceptable risk.

### How to Handle It

If you need to use this exception:

1. **Act decisively** — Hesitation in emergencies creates more danger
2. **Explain afterward** — The person deserves to understand why, once it's safe to explain
3. **Distinguish it from punishment** — Make clear this doesn't affect their standing for future events (unless their behavior afterward warrants it)
4. **Document what happened** — Write it down while it's fresh, including what you observed and why you made the call
5. **Debrief with your team** — Talk through whether it was the right call and what you learned

### The Underlying Principle

The promise protects participants from arbitrary removal—from being kicked out because someone's mad, or because a mob pressured you, or because you made an honest mistake.

The emergency exception acknowledges that your primary job is safety, and sometimes safety requires acting before rules are technically broken.

These aren't in conflict. Both serve the same goal: a container where people can trust that they're protected—from unfair treatment AND from genuine danger.

---

## When You See Someone Fawning

Sometimes you'll witness a dynamic where one participant is being belligerent—attacking, accusing, name-calling—and the other is just... taking it. Appeasing. Not defending themselves.

They're [fawning](./fawning.md).

As a facilitator, you have a choice. You could just watch. Or you could help.

### The Intervention

If you see someone fawning to an aggressor, consider stepping in—not to fight their battle for them, but to support them in fighting it themselves.

**What this might look like:**

- Quietly: "Hey, I notice you're not being spoken to with respect. You can set a boundary here. I have your back."
- More directly: "It looks like you might be appeasing right now. You don't have to accept being treated this way. What do you actually want to say?"
- To both parties: "Let's pause. [Fawner], I want to make sure you're able to speak freely here. Do you feel safe to say what you actually think?"

### Why This Matters

The lesson you're teaching is one of the most important ones:

> **I can't keep you safe. Only you can. But I'll support you while you do it.**

Until someone learns to stand up for themselves, they'll continue to be treated badly. They'll continue to receive punishment they don't deserve. They'll continue to create situations where they're the victim—because they won't set boundaries.

By prompting them to set a boundary—and backing them up when they do—you're helping them learn to protect themselves. That's more valuable than protecting them yourself.

### Considerations

- **They might not be ready.** You can prompt and support, but you can't force someone to stand up for themselves before they're able. If they can't do it yet, that's okay. The seed is planted.

- **Don't put them on the spot.** A quiet word of support is often more effective than announcing to the room "I think you're fawning."

- **Timing matters.** Sometimes you need to de-escalate first, then coach afterward. Sometimes real-time prompting is exactly what they need. Read the situation.

- **Model what you're asking.** If you're asking them to set boundaries with someone being aggressive, make sure you're doing the same. Show, don't just tell.

### What You're Showing

When you help someone recognize their fawning and support them in setting boundaries, you model:

- Self-respect can be learned
- Facilitators aren't here to rescue you—they're here to empower you
- You have the right to be treated with dignity, and the responsibility to enforce it
- The container supports people standing up for themselves

This is the [Creator](./drama-triangle.md) dynamic, not the Rescuer dynamic. You're not saving them. You're helping them save themselves.

## Show, Don't Tell

Your participants learn more from what you do than what you say.

| What You Say                    | What You Do                                  | What They Learn                  |
| ------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| "Everyone deserves respect"     | You let someone disrespect you               | Respect is optional when angry   |
| "Mistakes don't mean leaving"   | You kick someone out under pressure          | Mob pressure wins                |
| "We verify before judging"      | You take action based on one side            | Verification is lip service      |
| "Proportional responses matter" | You let HIGH responses to LOW mistakes slide | Severity doesn't actually matter |

**If your actions contradict your words, your actions are what people remember.**

This is why walking your talk is the most important thing as a facilitator. Not your curriculum. Not your marketing. Not your reputation.

Your integrity.

## What to Do When Someone Reports

_[Section in development: Protocol for when a participant reports an incident]_

1. Listen first, without judgment
2. Gather primary source information from all parties
3. Assess severity based on what actually happened
4. Respond proportionally
5. Don't let the reporter's emotional intensity determine your response
6. Remember: the reporter may be over-responding, fawning, or creating a story
