# I Made a Mistake—What Now?

You made a mistake. You're here because you recognize that.

This page is about what comes next: how to think about yourself, how to maintain your sense of self, and what actions to take depending on what kind of mistake you made.

## Protect Your Identity

The first thing to understand: **a mistake does not define you.**

What you did is not who you are. The stories other people tell about you—including harsh ones—are not the truth of your being. You are a human who did something that caused harm. That's it.

This matters because:

- If you let the mistake become your identity, you'll either collapse into shame (and become useless) or become defensive (and learn nothing)
- If you let others' judgments define you, you give away your power
- Self-flagellation doesn't help the person you harmed—it just makes you feel like you've paid a price

**The goal is to stay grounded enough to actually take responsibility**—which requires a stable sense of self.

> The person who harmed someone and then spirals into "I'm a terrible person" is not taking responsibility. They're making it about themselves.

Real responsibility looks like:

- Acknowledging what happened clearly
- Understanding the impact
- Taking action to repair
- Learning so it doesn't happen again

None of that requires destroying yourself.

## What Kind of Mistake Did You Make?

How you should think about this depends on the nature of your mistake.

### Unconscious Mistakes

You didn't know. You crossed a boundary you weren't aware of. You hurt someone without intending to—maybe without even realizing it until later.

**How to think about it:**

This is the most common kind of mistake. It doesn't make you a predator. It makes you human.

The question isn't "am I a bad person?" It's:

- What didn't I know that I should have known?
- What signs did I miss?
- What conversations should I have had beforehand?
- How can I be more aware next time?

**What to do:**

1. Acknowledge the harm—don't minimize it
2. Apologize without excessive self-flagellation
3. Ask what would help repair it (see [Making It Right](./making-it-right.md))
4. Actually learn—update your behavior going forward

### Conscious Mistakes

You knew it was wrong, or at least questionable, and you did it anyway. Maybe you pushed past a soft boundary. Maybe you let desire override judgment. Maybe you convinced yourself it would be fine.

**How to think about it:**

This is harder. You can't hide behind "I didn't know."

But here's the thing: this still doesn't make you irredeemable. It makes you someone who made a choice you regret. The question is what you do now.

Be honest with yourself:

- What was I telling myself in the moment to justify this?
- What need was I trying to meet?
- What would I do differently if I could go back?

**What to do:**

1. Full accountability—no minimizing, no excuses
2. Real apology (see [Making It Right](./making-it-right.md))
3. Examine the pattern—is this a one-time lapse or a recurring blind spot?
4. Consider: do you need support (therapy, coaching, community) to address this pattern?

### The Over-Response Mistake

This one is different.

Someone did something to you—maybe they crossed a boundary, made an inappropriate comment, touched you in a way you didn't want. A real harm occurred.

And then you responded with a level of severity that far exceeded theirs.

They made a **medium** or **low** severity mistake.  
You responded with **high** severity harm.

Maybe you:

- Publicly attacked their character
- Organized others against them
- Reported them as a predator when they made an honest mistake
- Caused lasting damage to their reputation, relationships, or livelihood
- Responded with threats or actual violence

**If you're reading this section, I want to say something first:**

Congratulations.

Seriously. Most people who over-respond never catch themselves. And even if they do, they stay in denial about it. They say things like:

- "Well, I was just a little angrier than I should have been"
- "They deserved it"
- "I was triggered, so it's not my fault"
- "What I did wasn't that bad"

When the reality is: someone did you medium harm, and you did them permanent harm. That's a significant difference.

**The fact that you can see this puts you ahead of almost everyone.**

**How to think about it:**

Your original hurt was real. You were harmed. That matters.

And: your response caused more harm than what was done to you. Both things are true.

This is hard to hold. Your brain wants to justify the response because you were hurt first. But look at the actual outcomes:

| What They Did                       | What You Did                    |
| ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Temporary discomfort?               | Lasting damage?                 |
| Mistake they'd have apologized for? | Something that can't be undone? |
| Private incident?                   | Public destruction?             |

If your response was disproportionate, you became the primary source of harm in this situation—even though you were harmed first.

**What to do:**

1. **Acknowledge the asymmetry** — not to minimize what they did, but to see clearly what you did
2. **Recognize the power you wielded** — you used real power (social, institutional, reputational) to cause harm
3. **Consider repair** — can you undo some of the damage? Correct the record? Reach out?
4. **Examine the pattern** — do you tend toward high-severity responses when triggered? This is important to know about yourself
5. **Get support** — this kind of response often comes from old wounds. Therapy or trauma work may help

The person you harmed may not forgive you. That's their right. Your job is to do what you can to repair, and to ensure this doesn't happen again.

## The Stories Others Tell

After a mistake—especially a public one—people will have opinions. Some will be understanding. Some will be harsh. Some will be completely inaccurate.

**Remember:**

Their stories about you are based on their filters, their fears, their projections. They're not seeing you—they're seeing their _story_ about you.

This doesn't mean you ignore all feedback. Accurate feedback is valuable.

But don't let someone else's story become your identity. Listen, learn what's useful, and release the rest.

**Signs you're letting others' stories define you:**

- You feel crushed by criticism, unable to function
- You feel the need to prove yourself to everyone
- You're obsessing over what people think
- You feel fundamentally worthless

**The antidote:**

- You made a mistake. That's a fact.
- What you do next determines who you become.
- Your worth is not up for vote.

## Moving Forward

A mistake is an opportunity.

Not in a toxic-positivity way—real harm happened, and that matters. But you now have information you didn't have before. You know something about yourself, about your patterns, about what you're capable of.

**The question is:** what will you do with that knowledge?

The person who makes a mistake and learns nothing is likely to repeat it.

The person who makes a mistake and collapses into shame is too busy suffering to grow.

The person who makes a mistake, takes responsibility, repairs what they can, and updates their behavior—that person becomes someone better than they were before.

That's available to you.
