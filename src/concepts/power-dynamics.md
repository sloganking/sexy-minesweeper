## The Myth

> "The person in a position of power has power over me."

This is often not true.

In fact, it's frequently the opposite. The person who _appears_ to have less power often has more—they just don't recognize it.

## Everyone Creates the Container

At a workshop, retreat, or play party, who creates what happens?

Most people would say: "The facilitators. They're in charge."

**This is a myth.**

In reality, everyone—participants, assistants, staff, and facilitators—are all significant creators of the container. Every person present shapes what happens through their actions, reactions, presence, and choices.

If you think a facilitator has more power to determine what happens than you do, you may be mistaken. You may have:

- More power than them
- Equal power used in different ways
- Simply more _willingness_ to use your power than they have

Facilitators aren't all-powerful gods running the event. They're humans with patterns, limitations, and vulnerabilities—just like everyone else.

## The Counterintuitive Reality

Sometimes participants have **more power** over facilitators than facilitators have over them.

Here's how:

| Power Participants Have                            | Power Facilitators Often Don't Have   |
| -------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Can write negative reviews that destroy reputation | Must maintain professional composure  |
| Can start witch hunts in the community             | Would be condemned for doing the same |
| Can make accusations (true or false)               | Must defend themselves carefully      |
| Can threaten, intimidate, escalate                 | Must de-escalate and hold boundaries  |
| Can mobilize others against staff                  | Would look abusive doing the same     |
| Can leave and bad-mouth the event                  | Depend on reputation for livelihood   |

**Participants have offensive options that facilitators don't.** Facilitators are expected to act responsibly. Participants often aren't held to the same standard—and even when they behave inappropriately, mobs may still take their side.

## Let's Be Explicit: Participants Can Be Abusers

Here's what we rarely say out loud:

**Participants can abuse their power over facilitators and staff.**

Not "might theoretically be able to." Not "in rare edge cases." **Can. Do. Regularly.**

And here's what's even more uncomfortable:

**It's much, much easier for participants to abuse their power over facilitators than the reverse.**

Why? Because:

- Facilitators are held to professional standards. Participants often aren't.
- Facilitators can't fight back without looking like abusers themselves.
- Facilitators depend on reputation for their livelihood. Participants can attack anonymously.
- Society expects facilitators to be accountable. It often gives participants a pass.
- Mobs side with the person crying, not the person holding boundaries.

A facilitator who abuses power gets called out, cancelled, and removed. A participant who abuses power often gets sympathy, support, and followers.

This asymmetry makes participant abuse of power easier to commit and harder to address.

### When Does Power Become Abuse?

If you are a participant, you have power. Significant power. The question is how you use it.

**This is NOT abuse:**

- Sharing your genuine experience to protect others
- Calling out harmful behavior you verified actually happened
- Setting boundaries and leaving when they're crossed
- Asking for accountability proportional to what occurred

**This IS abuse:**

- Using reputation damage as a threat to get compliance ("Do what I want or I'll destroy you")
- Mobilizing a group against someone without verifying what actually happened
- Weaponizing accusations to punish someone—not to protect others, but because you're angry
- Exaggerating or fabricating claims to maximize damage
- Starting a witch hunt based on feelings, vibes, or gossip rather than verified facts
- Intimidating staff into letting you violate boundaries
- Inflicting HIGH severity consequences for LOW severity mistakes

The difference between accountability and abuse is:

| Accountability                        | Abuse                                     |
| ------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Based on verified facts               | Based on feelings, assumptions, or gossip |
| Proportional to what happened         | Maximized for punishment                  |
| Protects others from future harm      | Punishes for past perceived slights       |
| Open to being wrong                   | Certain of rightness without verification |
| Takes responsibility for own response | Blames entirely, takes no responsibility  |

If your actions look like the right column, you're not holding someone accountable. You're abusing your power.

### The Language We Need to Use

When a facilitator uses their position to coerce sexual favors, we call it **abuse of power.**

When a boss threatens an employee's livelihood to get compliance, we call it **abuse of power.**

When a participant threatens a facilitator's reputation, livelihood, and safety to get what they want, we need to call it what it is:

**Abuse of power.**

When participants start witch hunts against facilitators based on unverified accusations, mob judgment, and emotional contagion, we need to call it what it is:

**Abuse of power.**

When someone weaponizes victim status to destroy someone who made an innocent mistake, we need to call it what it is:

**Abuse of power.**

### You Are Not Exempt

If you're reading this and thinking "but I would never do that"—good.

But also: have you ever repeated an accusation you didn't verify? Joined a pile-on because others were upset? Made a judgment based on vibes instead of facts?

Those are the first steps toward abuse.

**You have more power than you think. Act like it. Wield it responsibly. Or you become the abuser.**

The same standards we apply to facilitators apply to you. If it would be abuse for them to do it, it's abuse for you to do it. Full stop.

## Example: The Intimidating Participant

Imagine this scenario:

Something happens at a retreat. A participant—let's call them **Jordan**—has an [over-response](./appropriate-response.md). Their reaction is HIGH severity to what was actually a LOW or MEDIUM issue.

Jordan is furious. They're yelling, making threats, physically intimidating others.

What _should_ happen: The facilitator sets a boundary. "You can't threaten people here. If you continue, you'll need to leave."

What _often_ happens:

**The facilitator [fawns](./fawning.md).**

They're scared. They're thinking:

- "What if Jordan goes home and writes hate mail?"
- "What if Jordan starts a witch hunt online?"
- "What if Jordan gets violent?"
- "What if other participants side with Jordan?"

So instead of enforcing boundaries, the facilitator appeases. They let Jordan's behavior slide. They prioritize de-escalation over integrity.

**Jordan now has power over the facilitator.**

Not because Jordan has legitimate authority—but because Jordan is willing to use aggression, and the facilitator is afraid of the consequences.

### Even When the Facilitator Does Everything Right

Let's say the facilitator _doesn't_ fawn. They set clear boundaries:

> "Jordan, I understand you're upset. But you cannot threaten people in this space. If you continue, I'll ask you to leave and not return."

Even now, Jordan still has power:

- Jordan can go home and write hate mail
- Jordan can start a witch hunt on social media
- Jordan can rally other participants against the facilitator _during_ the event
- Others might side with Jordan out of [mob judgment](./before-you-judge.md)—because they saw Jordan upset and the facilitator "kicking them out"

The facilitator did everything right. And they're still vulnerable to someone who is willing to wield victim status as a weapon.

## Example: High-Profile Relationships

This dynamic isn't limited to workshops. It happens everywhere.

Consider a famous, wealthy, influential person—let's call them a public figure. At first glance, they appear to have immense power in their marriage:

- They have money
- They have status
- They have influence
- Their spouse may derive significance from being married to them

People assume: "Obviously the public figure has power over their spouse."

But when the marriage ends, the spouse can:

- Sue for amounts that exceed what the public figure owns
- Make public accusations (true or false)
- Play victim to the media
- Mobilize public opinion
- Destroy reputation with claims that are difficult to disprove

Suddenly, the "powerless" spouse has more power than the "powerful" public figure.

> If you cry victim loud enough, you become the perpetrator.

This isn't about who's right or wrong. It's about recognizing that **power dynamics are never one-way**—and the person who appears powerless often has weapons the "powerful" person doesn't.

## Why People Don't See Their Power

Most participants in workshops genuinely believe they're powerless relative to facilitators.

They think:

- "The facilitators control the event"
- "I'm just here as a guest"
- "They have authority over me"
- "If something goes wrong, it's their fault"

This is [Victim](./drama-triangle.md) thinking. It denies responsibility by denying power.

But denying your power doesn't make it go away. It just means you wield it unconsciously—and often destructively.

## The Responsibility That Comes With Power

If you have power, you have [responsibility](./responsibility.md).

Participants are responsible for:

- How they show up in the container
- How they respond when things go wrong
- Whether they verify before judging ([Before You Judge](./before-you-judge.md))
- Whether their response matches the severity ([Appropriate Response](./appropriate-response.md))
- The impact of their words and actions on facilitators and other participants

You are not a passive consumer of the event. You are a co-creator of what happens.

## The Belief to Refine

> The idea that power dynamics are one-way is always a myth.

This myth is created by people not recognizing their own power.

When you don't recognize your power:

- You don't take [responsibility](./responsibility.md) for it
- You may wield it unconsciously
- You may wield it destructively while believing yourself powerless
- You may harm people while feeling like the victim

## Power Goes Both Ways

| Traditional View                       | Reality                                       |
| -------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Facilitator has power over participant | Participant can also harm facilitator         |
| Authority figure is always "up"        | Authority figures can be vulnerable           |
| Victim has no power                    | Victim status can be weaponized               |
| Famous person controls the dynamic     | Less-famous person can destroy them publicly  |
| The "powerful" person is the threat    | The "powerless" person may be the real threat |

This doesn't mean victims aren't real or that power imbalances don't exist.

It means: **Everyone has more power than they think.**

And with power comes responsibility.
