# 100% Control

## The Concept

It takes two to dance.

When something you don't want occurs while interacting with another person, multiple people played a part in creating that outcome.

**However:** The majority of the time, you have the power to control 100% of the outcome.

## The Dance Metaphor

> If somebody invites you to dance, you both have to say yes in order for the dance to happen.
>
> If either of you say no, the dance doesn't happen.

**That's what 100% control means.**

You don't have just part of the power. Oftentimes, you have ALL the power to create the reality you want.

## What This Is NOT

This does **not** abdicate other participants from [responsibility](../concepts/responsibility.md).

Everyone, via action or inaction, created what happened.

This is just a way of recognizing YOUR power:

- Showing you how you can create what you want
- Even in the face of actors who have other goals
- Even when others want different things
- It's showing you how you can create your own safety

## Why This Matters

When people don't see their power:

- They don't take responsibility
- They feel like victims of circumstance
- They wait for others to change
- They stay stuck

When people see their 100% control:

- They recognize their choices
- They can create different outcomes
- They stop waiting for the world to be different
- They become empowered

## Teaching This

This is about empowerment, not blame.

You're not saying "it's your fault."

You're saying: **"You have more power than you realized. Let's look at how you can use it."**
