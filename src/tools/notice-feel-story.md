# Notice, Feel, Story

## The Problem

When something happens, we instantly create a story about it.

Someone leaves without saying goodbye → "They don't like me anymore."
Someone doesn't respond to a text → "They're ignoring me."
Someone touches you in a way you didn't expect → "They're a predator."

The story feels like truth. It feels like what happened. But it's not.

**What happened is what happened. Your story is your interpretation.**

And your interpretation might be completely wrong.

## The Three-Step Framework

This tool comes from Authentic Relating. It separates observation, feeling, and interpretation—so you can check your story before acting on it.

### Step 1: Notice (Observation)

State what you actually observed. Just the facts. No interpretation.

- ✓ "I notice you left without saying anything when we were cuddling earlier."
- ✗ "I notice you abandoned me." (That's a story, not an observation.)

### Step 2: Feel (Emotion)

State the emotion you experienced. Not a thought disguised as a feeling.

- ✓ "I felt sad and disconnected."
- ✗ "I felt like you don't care about me." (That's a story, not a feeling.)

### Step 3: Story (Interpretation) + Check

State your interpretation explicitly as a story—then ask if it's true.

- ✓ "My story is that you don't want to interact with me anymore. Is there any truth to that?"
- ✗ "You obviously don't want to be around me." (Stated as fact, not checked.)

## Why This Works

### It Separates Feelings from Stories

When someone says "I feel like you don't care about me," they've fused feeling and interpretation.

If the other person says "But I do care about you," it sounds like they're invalidating the feeling. Now there's a fight about whether the feeling is valid.

But if you say:

> "I feel sad and disconnected. My story is that you don't care about me."

The other person can:

1. **Validate your feeling**: "I'm sorry you felt sad and disconnected."
2. **Correct the story**: "I do care about you—I just had to leave quickly for a call."

No invalidation. No fight. Clear communication.

### It Reveals Your Interpretations as Stories

Most people don't realize how much of what they "know" is actually interpretation.

When you practice saying "my story is..." you start to recognize:

- This is just what I think happened
- I don't actually know if it's true
- I need to check before acting on it

This is especially critical for witnesses—and this is why [witnessing isn't enough](../concepts/before-you-judge.md#witnessing-isnt-enough). You saw something. You created a story. **That story is not evidence.**

### It Creates a Non-Charged Way to Verify

Instead of:

> "Why did you abandon me?!" (accusation)

You say:

> "I noticed you left. I felt hurt. My story is you didn't want to be around me. Is there any truth to that?" (inquiry)

The first creates defensiveness. The second creates dialogue.

### It Makes High-Stakes Conversations Inarguable

Here's something powerful: when you use this framework, everything you say is **inarguable**.

- **What you noticed** — This is your subjective observation. No one can tell you that you didn't notice what you noticed.
- **What you felt** — This is your internal experience. No one can tell you that you didn't feel what you felt.
- **Your story** — You're explicitly naming it as a story, not claiming it as truth. You're asking if it's true, not asserting it.

There's nothing to fight about. You're not making claims about objective reality. You're sharing your subjective experience and asking for clarification.

When conversations get heated, people start making claims about what the other person did, meant, or intended. Those claims are arguable. "You abandoned me!" invites "No I didn't!"

But "I noticed you left. I felt hurt. My story is you didn't want to be around me. Is there any truth to that?" — what is there to argue with?

**In high-stakes conversations, moving to inarguable language can be the difference between war and real communication.**

Both people can use this framework. You can go back and forth—each person sharing what they noticed, what they felt, and what their story is—and actually understand each other instead of just attacking.

## Examples

### Example 1: Cuddling

> "I noticed you left without saying anything when we were cuddling earlier. I felt disconnected and a little sad. My story is that you didn't want to interact with me anymore. Is there any truth to that?"

Possible response: "Oh no, I'm so sorry—I had to use the bathroom urgently and didn't want to wake you. I was planning to come back!"

**Story was wrong. Feelings were valid. No harm done.**

### Example 2: Touch

> "I noticed your hand moved to my thigh during the exercise. I felt startled and a bit uncomfortable. My story is that you were trying to escalate sexually. Was that what was happening?"

Possible response: "I'm so sorry—I wasn't aware my hand had moved there. I was just shifting position. Thank you for telling me."

**Story was wrong. Feelings were valid. Repaired immediately.**

### Example 3: Witnessing

> "I noticed you and Jordan had a heated conversation and Jordan left upset. I felt concerned. My story is that something bad happened between you two. Can you tell me what was going on?"

Possible response: "Jordan got some hard news from home and needed to leave. We were just talking about logistics. They were upset about the news, not about me."

**Story was wrong. You didn't start a witch hunt. Good job.**

### Example 4: When the Story Is Right

> "I noticed you kept touching my back after I moved away twice. I felt uncomfortable and a little unsafe. My story is that you weren't respecting my nonverbal cues. Is there any truth to that?"

Possible response: "...Yeah, honestly, I think you're right. I got caught up in the moment and wasn't paying attention. I'm sorry. I should have noticed you were pulling away."

**Story was correct. Now you know. And because you checked instead of accused, you got an honest acknowledgment instead of defensive denial.**

Sometimes your interpretation is right. The point isn't that you're always wrong—it's that you don't know until you verify. When you're right, checking confirms it. When you're wrong, checking prevents harm. Either way, you win.

## When to Use This

- Before making accusations
- Before telling others what "happened"
- Before responding with HIGH severity
- Before judging someone's character
- When you notice yourself feeling charged about something
- When you witnessed something and created a story about it

## The Meta-Skill

The more you practice this, the more you realize:

**Almost everything you "know" about other people's intentions is a story.**

You don't know why they did what they did. You don't know what they were thinking. You don't know if they meant harm.

You have observations. You have feelings. And you have stories.

**Check the stories before you act on them.**
