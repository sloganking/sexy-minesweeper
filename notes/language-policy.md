# Language Policy

This book uses **inarguable language**—descriptions that anyone on any side of an incident could read without feeling attacked or mischaracterized.

## Why This Matters

The words we use affect how we see the world. If your vocabulary only contains victim-frame terms, you can only think about experiences through a victim lens. Words are spells. Don't hex yourself small.

**Language reveals where you are in the healing process:**
- Still wounded: "I was violated," "character assassination," "witch hunt"
- Healing: "They touched me without consent," "attacked my reputation publicly," "coordinated attack"
- Healed: You can describe what happened neutrally, AND your attention isn't on it day-to-day. You're focused forward on creating what you want.

## Terms to Remove (Author Voice Only)

These terms should NOT appear in the author's voice. They may appear in quotes/examples of what others say.

| Remove | Replace With | Why |
|--------|--------------|-----|
| character assassination | attacked reputation publicly, reputation attack | Implies malicious intent; "assassination" is dramatic/victim-frame |
| violated | boundaries crossed, touched without consent, harmed | Judgment wrapped in description; morally loaded |
| witch hunt | coordinated attack, pile-on, accusation cascade | Victim-frame; implies the attackers are irrational |
| predator (as label) | person who harmed, person who crossed boundaries | Moralizing label vs. description of behavior |
| victim (as identity) | person who was harmed, person who experienced X | Identity vs. event |
| abuser (as label) | person who caused harm | Moralizing label vs. description |
| banished | excluded, removed, asked to leave | Dramatic/medieval; implies righteous exile |

## Terms That Are Borderline (Evaluate Case-by-Case)

| Term | Notes |
|------|-------|
| abuse | May be acceptable when describing a pattern of behavior, not as a dramatic label |
| attack | Acceptable—describes action, not character |
| over-response | Acceptable—describes proportionality, not character |

## Terms That Are Fine

| Term | Why |
|------|-----|
| mistake | Neutral |
| harm | Describes outcome |
| crossed boundaries | Describes action |
| without consent | Describes action |
| attacked | Describes action |
| disproportionate | Describes proportionality |

## Exceptions

- **Quotes/examples of what others say**: People in examples may use moralizing language because real people do.
- **Describing the concept**: We can discuss what "character assassination" means when explaining why we don't use the term.
- **Drama Triangle terms**: "Victim," "Persecutor," "Rescuer" are acceptable when discussing the Drama Triangle framework specifically.

## Running a Check

For each hit, ask: Is this the author's voice describing reality, or a quote/example/framework term?
