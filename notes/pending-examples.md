**This pattern in action:**

At a retreat, there's a group exercise where men are invited to embody their strength—shouting, flexing, expressing power. One participant looks uncomfortable. He says something like: "Isn't this what toxic masculinity is? Isn't this what we're supposed to stop?"

He's identified a type of behavior he rejects. Aggressive masculinity. Loud, dominating energy. He can't imagine himself doing that. He's here to be different.

Later in the retreat, someone makes a mistake. A LOW or MEDIUM severity accident.

This same participant—the one who couldn't imagine being aggressively masculine—becomes the loudest person in the room. Shouting. Screaming. More anger than anyone has seen in years. Playing hero, rushing to rescue, ready to harm anyone in his path who might interfere with his righteous cause. Making threats. Demanding punishment. Causing HIGH severity harm to someone who made a LOW severity mistake.

He's doing exactly what he said he was against. Aggressive. Dominating. Threatening. The only person in the room causing real harm.

And he can't see it.

Because in his reference frame, he's not being toxic—he's stopping a predator. He's not being aggressive—he's protecting the vulnerable. He's not causing harm—he's delivering justice.

The filter that made him unable to imagine himself as harmful is exactly what made him blind to being harmful. He became the embodiment of what he thought he was fighting against.

This happens more than people realize. The person most afraid of being X is often the person most likely to become X—because they're not watching for it in themselves. They've decided they're immune.
