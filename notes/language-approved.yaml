# Approved Language Instances
#
# Each entry represents a specific use of a flagged term that has been
# reviewed and approved. The checker matches by file + context substring.
#
# Format:
#   - term: "the flagged term"
#     file: "path/to/file.md"
#     context: "unique substring from that line"
#     reason: "why this instance is okay"
#
# Context should be a short, unique substring from the line containing
# the term. This is more stable than line numbers.
