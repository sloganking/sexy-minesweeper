## What This Is

This is a framework for navigating conflict, mistakes, and harm in sex-positive communities, somatic workshops, and intimacy-focused spaces.

It provides:

- **Concepts** — Severity scales, types of mistakes, trauma responses, power dynamics, and responsibility
- **Tools** — Practical frameworks like the Gun Test and 100% Control
- **Charts** — Visual aids for teaching and quick reference

### Core Ideas

- Most incidents are good-faith mistakes, not malice
- Everyone has responsibility—including "victims" and bystanders
- Response should match severity—not fear or trauma
- Verify before you judge; gossip creates witch hunts
- Power dynamics go both ways—participants can abuse facilitators too
- Fawning creates two victims, not one
