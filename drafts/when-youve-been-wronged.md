# When You've Been Wronged

← [Back to Introduction](../introduction.md)

---

This section is for when **you** are the target of an over-response.

You made a mistake—maybe LOW, maybe MEDIUM. And someone responded with HIGH-severity aggression. Character assassination. Accusations of being a predator. Witch hunt energy. Reputation damage.

This is one of the most disorienting, painful experiences in these spaces. And there's almost no guidance for it anywhere.

Here's what I've learned.

## First: Name What Happened

You're not crazy. What happened to you is wrong.

When someone responds to a MEDIUM mistake with HIGH-severity punishment, **they are [abusing their power as a victim](./drama-triangle.md#victim)**.

Their over-response doesn't mean you're a predator. It means they over-responded.

These can both be true:

- You made a mistake (own it)
- Their response was disproportionate and harmful (that's on them)

You don't have to choose. You can hold both.

## In the Moment

### Don't Fawn

The temptation when someone is attacking you is to appease. To over-apologize. To admit to things that aren't true just to make them stop.

**Don't do this.**

Fawning under threat is not a real apology. And everything you say while fawning can be used against you later. "But you admitted it!"

You can acknowledge your actual mistake without accepting their distorted story about who you are.

> "I understand that what happened affected you, and I take responsibility for my part. But I'm not available for being called a predator. That's not what happened, and I won't agree to it."

### Set Boundaries About How You're Spoken To

You don't have to stand there and absorb abuse.

> "I'm open to having a conversation about what happened when you're ready to speak to me with respect. Until then, I'm not available for this."

Then disengage. You don't owe them your presence while they attack you.

### Remember: Their Response Is Data About Them

Their over-response tells you about **their patterns**, not your worth.

- It tells you they struggle with proportional response
- It tells you they may have [trauma filters](./trauma-and-filters.md) that distort their perception
- It tells you they might not be safe to be vulnerable with

This is painful information. But it's valuable. You now know something about who they are.

### Document What Actually Happened

While it's fresh, write down:

- What actually occurred (your best honest account)
- What they said/did
- Who witnessed what
- Timeline

You may never need this. But if accusations escalate, having a contemporaneous record matters.

## Afterward: The Emotional Reality

Let's be honest: **this will take time.**

Maybe weeks. Maybe months. There's no shortcut.

You've been attacked. Your character has been questioned. You may have been publicly shamed for something that doesn't match reality. That's grief. That's trauma. It doesn't just evaporate because you understand the framework.

### What Helps

**Find support from people who can hold nuance.**

Not people who will just tell you the other person is evil. Not people who will tell you that you're evil. People who can say: "That sounds really hard. You made a mistake AND their response was disproportionate. Both are true."

**Take responsibility for YOUR actual mistake—no more, no less.**

This is hard when you've been accused of being a monster. The temptation is either to:

- Accept their whole story ("maybe I AM a predator")
- Reject all responsibility ("I did nothing wrong!")

Neither serves you. Find the middle: "I made a MEDIUM mistake. I wish I hadn't. I've learned from it. AND their response was disproportionate and harmful to me."

**Use the reframes from this book.**

- Their over-response is them [abusing their power as a victim](./drama-triangle.md#victim)
- You can [rescind the privilege of your touch](./fawning.md#your-touch-is-a-privilege) from people who don't respect it
- Being attacked doesn't make you a predator any more than their accusations make them right
- You are still a [Creator](./drama-triangle.md#creator), not a Victim—you can choose how to respond

**Let yourself feel it.**

Anger, grief, confusion, shame—all of it. Don't rush to "get over it." The feelings are information. They're processing.

## What Actions To Take

### Don't Counter-Attack

It's tempting. They attacked you. You want to defend yourself, expose their hypocrisy, show everyone what really happened.

Usually, this backfires. It escalates. It looks like you're "attacking the victim." It gives them more ammunition.

**Exception:** If there's a formal process (mediation, community accountability, legal), participate honestly. But public counter-attacks usually hurt you more.

### Consider Whether to Communicate Directly

Sometimes a direct conversation helps. Sometimes it makes things worse.

Questions to ask:

- Are they capable of hearing you right now, or are they fully in Victim/Persecutor mode?
- Do you have a mediator or third party who can help?
- What's the best realistic outcome of this conversation?

If they're still activated and you're still activated, waiting might be wiser.

### Talk to Facilitators/Community Leadership

If this happened in a container, the facilitators should know your side. Not to start a counter-witch-hunt, but so they have full information.

A good facilitator will:

- Hear both sides
- Recognize proportionality
- Not automatically side with whoever cried loudest

If the facilitator only listens to the accuser, that tells you something about the facilitator.

### Decide About This Person Going Forward

You get to choose who has access to you.

This person has shown you they respond to mistakes with disproportionate aggression. They've shown you they may not be safe to be vulnerable with.

You don't have to forgive them. You don't have to reconcile. You can simply decide: this person doesn't get the privilege of my presence, my touch, my vulnerability anymore.

That's not bitterness. That's [taking responsibility](./responsibility.md) for your own safety.

## The Hardest Part

Here's what no one wants to say:

**Sometimes there's nothing you can do.**

Sometimes the witch hunt happens anyway. Sometimes your reputation takes a hit. Sometimes people believe them. Sometimes there's no justice, no vindication, no moment where everyone realizes you were treated unfairly.

This is reality. It sucks.

What you can control:

- How you respond
- Who you allow in your life going forward
- How you process and heal
- What you learn for the future

What you can't control:

- What they think
- What others believe
- Whether you get an apology

Focus on what you can control. Let go of what you can't. Not because it's fair—it isn't—but because holding onto it only extends your suffering.

## The Long View

Over time, truth tends to emerge.

People who over-respond once usually over-respond again. Their pattern becomes visible. Others start to notice.

Meanwhile, if you conduct yourself with integrity—taking responsibility for your actual mistakes without accepting false accusations—that becomes visible too.

You don't need to prove anything. Just keep being who you are. The people worth having in your life will see it.

## You're Not Alone

This happens more than people talk about. Many people in these spaces have experienced being on the wrong end of an over-response, a witch hunt, a disproportionate attack.

Most of them stay silent because speaking up risks being attacked again.

But know this: you're not the first. You're not alone. And the fact that it happened to you doesn't mean you're what they said you are.

Take responsibility for your actual mistakes. Reject the distortions. Heal. And keep going.

## The Way Out

Everything above tells you what to do. This section is about something deeper: why you feel like a victim, and how to stop.

If you've been attacked—really attacked, by someone who intended to harm you—you probably feel some combination of:

- Helpless
- Angry
- Like something was done TO you that you couldn't stop
- Like a victim

Here's what I discovered about why that feeling persists:

**You fawned.**

Not in the "I said yes when I meant no" sense. In the deeper sense: you had power, and you didn't use it.

You could have said "No, you can't do this to me" and left. You could have set a boundary. You could have enforced consequences. You could have turned your ears off and stopped receiving the abuse.

But you didn't. You stayed. You absorbed it. You fawned—not because you wanted to, but because your body did what it learned to do when faced with an angry person: freeze, appease, endure.

And because you didn't use your power, you experienced yourself as powerless. That's where the victim feeling lives.

### The Shift

Here's what changes everything:

**The victim feeling comes from not using your power—not from what was done to you.**

Read that again.

You feel like a victim because you didn't defend yourself. Because you stayed when you could have left. Because you absorbed attacks you didn't have to receive.

The harm was real. They may have genuinely intended to hurt you. AND you had power. Both are true.

Once you see that you HAD power—that you just didn't use it—something shifts:

1. **You stop feeling helpless** (because you weren't)
2. **The anger dissolves** (because anger is what happens when you feel wronged AND powerless—remove the powerless, and the anger has nowhere to live)
3. **You can do it differently next time** (because now you know you can)

### It Doesn't Matter If They're Mad

This might be the most important sentence in this chapter:

> **It doesn't matter if they're fucking mad.**

Your inner child might believe that the only way to be safe is to make the angry person not angry. That if someone is mad at you, you have to fix it, appease them, earn their approval, or suffer until they're done.

That's not true.

They can be mad. They can be furious. They can scream and cry and threaten. And you can say "I'm not receiving this" and walk away. Their anger is their problem. Not yours.

You don't have to stand there and absorb it. You don't have to convince them they're wrong. You don't have to wait for them to stop. You can just... leave. Or enforce a boundary. Or tell the facilitators to do their job.

The angry person has no power over you unless you stay and fawn.

### But They Intended to Harm Me

Yes. Maybe they did.

Maybe they genuinely wanted to violate your boundaries. Maybe they wanted you to suffer. Maybe they're a predator in the actual sense—someone who derives satisfaction from your pain.

That doesn't change anything about YOUR power.

Predators can only succeed if you stay and receive it. Fawning is what gives them access. If you don't fawn—if you say "no" and leave and enforce consequences—they're just an angry person pissing themselves. Their intention to harm you doesn't magically remove your ability to not be harmed.

The victim frame says: "They intended harm, therefore I'm a victim."

The creator frame says: "They intended harm, AND I had power, AND I didn't use it, AND I can use it next time."

You can acknowledge that someone genuinely tried to hurt you without surrendering your agency. Both are true. Hold both.

### "But I Genuinely Had No Power"

Maybe you're reading this and thinking: "That's nice, but I actually _couldn't_ leave. I was a child. I was physically restrained. I was in a situation where 'just say no and walk away' wasn't an option."

Fair. There are situations where power is genuinely limited. Where leaving wasn't possible. Where defending yourself would have made things worse.

Here's the distinction:

**Being victimized** = having harm done to you when you had limited or no power to stop it. This can be real. It happens.

**Feeling like a victim** = the ongoing emotional state of helplessness, anger, and "this was done TO me and I can't do anything."

The insight isn't about the past event. It's about the present feeling.

You may have been genuinely powerless _then_. But you're not powerless _now_. The ongoing victim feeling persists when you're still seeing yourself as powerless in the present—when you haven't recognized that whatever power you lacked then, you have now.

The child who was abused had no power to stop it. The adult that child became _does_ have power—to heal, to set boundaries, to choose who gets access to them, to build a life that isn't defined by what happened.

The shift isn't "you could have stopped it and didn't." The shift is "that was then, and now you have power you didn't have before. What will you do with it?"

If you were genuinely powerless in the past, the victim feeling dissolves not by rewriting history, but by claiming your _current_ power. You're not that child anymore. You're not restrained anymore. You're not in that situation anymore.

What power do you have now? Use it.

### Where the Powerlessness Came From

Something happened in your past—childhood, a traumatic situation—where defending yourself wasn't safe.

Maybe standing up would have made it worse. Maybe the person was bigger, stronger, had authority over you. Maybe you learned that anger from others meant danger, and the only way to survive was to appease.

So your nervous system recorded a lesson: _When faced with this kind of situation, don't fight. Appease. Fawn. Survive._

That lesson made sense then. It may have saved you.

The problem is it's still running now—in situations where it no longer applies.

### Why You're Still Stuck

The belief that you can't handle certain situations follows you around. Not as a conscious thought—as a felt sense. A background hum of _something bad is coming, and I won't be able to handle it_.

This is what depression often is: the anticipation of powerlessness. The sense that situations you can't control are coming, and you'll be helpless when they arrive.

This is what anxiety often is: the nervous system scanning for the next threat, the next moment where you'll need to fawn to survive.

This is what the victim feeling is: _I can't handle what's happening. I have no power here._

Your nervous system is running an old program. It learned powerlessness once, and it hasn't updated.

### Why Knowing Isn't Enough

You might already understand intellectually that you can handle things now. That you're not a child anymore. That the old situation is over.

Understanding doesn't change it.

Your nervous system doesn't update through insight. It updates through _experience_. It needs proof—not words, but lived moments where you faced the thing you feared and discovered you could handle it.

This is why therapy often fails to change automatic responses. You can understand perfectly well that you should say no—and watch yourself fawn anyway. The understanding lives in your prefrontal cortex. The pattern lives in your body.

### How You Actually Heal

Your nervous system needs to experience: _I stood up. I said no. I defended myself. And nothing terrible happened. I can handle this._

Not once. Repeatedly. Until the new pattern overwrites the old one.

This is what the [fawning exercise](./fawning.md#how-to-actually-heal) does. It creates controlled situations where you practice the completion of the pattern—letting discomfort build until anger arises, then saying no. Your body learns: _I can do this. I survived. The thing I feared didn't destroy me._

Each time you do this, the old belief weakens. The anticipation of powerlessness fades. Because your body now has counter-evidence.

### The Painful Irony

Here's what's hard to swallow:

The suffering you experienced? The fear, the pain, the feeling of being violated?

Much of it came from your own fawning.

Not from what they did. From you staying and receiving it. From you not using your power to leave, to set boundaries, to make it stop.

This isn't victim-blaming. The person who attacked you is still responsible for being an attacker. But the duration and intensity of your suffering was largely determined by how long you stayed in a situation you could have left.

That's bitter medicine. But it's also freedom.

Because if your suffering came from not using your power, then using your power is the way out. You don't need them to apologize. You don't need justice. You don't need vindication. You just need to recognize: _I had power. I didn't use it. I can use it next time._

### What Dissolves

When your body believes it—not just your mind—something shifts.

The depression fades. Because depression was the anticipation of powerlessness, and you're no longer powerless.

The anxiety fades. Because anxiety was your nervous system scanning for threats you couldn't handle, and now you know you can.

The victim feeling fades. Because the victim feeling was _I can't handle this_, and you've proven to yourself that you can.

You're not in that old situation anymore. You're not that child. You're not restrained. You're not facing someone you can't stand up to.

And even when you face difficult people—angry, threatening, scary—you know now that you can say "I'm not receiving this" and walk away. Their anger doesn't control you. You have power.

What claiming that power looks like is different for everyone. Maybe you take a self-defense class. Maybe you carry pepper spray. Maybe you develop the foresight to recognize dangerous situations earlier. Maybe you practice the tools in this book until responsibility isn't just something you understand, but something you embody.

You'll know you've succeeded—not just intellectually understood, but become one with it—when the anger and victim feelings melt away and you feel safe. Not "safe because nothing bad can happen," but safe because you can handle whatever the world brings. That confidence, that sense of capability, is what replaces the victim feeling.

Until you get there, the depression and anger come from anticipated powerlessness: the sense that obstacles are coming, situations you won't be able to control, moments where you'll feel helpless again. The healing happens when that anticipation dissolves—when it's replaced by: _Whatever happens, I can handle it._

That knowing—not intellectual, but embodied—is what sets you free.

### What This Means Going Forward

You're not a victim. You were someone who fawned.

Now you know. And knowing changes everything.

Next time someone attacks you:

- You can say "I'm not receiving this" and leave
- You can enforce boundaries without waiting for their permission
- You can make facilitators follow their own values
- You can stop absorbing abuse that you don't have to absorb

Their anger doesn't control you. Their intentions don't determine your experience. You have power—real power—to not be a victim.

Use it.
