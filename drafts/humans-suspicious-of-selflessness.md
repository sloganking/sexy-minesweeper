## The Core Insight

Most people assume being selfish is easy and being selfless takes strength. It's the opposite.

Many people are genuinely selfless—they want to help because they care. But because our culture teaches that humans are inherently selfish, pure generosity triggers suspicion.

"What do you want from me? Where's the catch?"

Someone trying to help you see your own power—benevolently, because they don't want you to keep suffering—may be mistaken for a manipulator. They must want something. They must be trying to dodge accountability. They must be selfish *somewhere*.

This is why so many misunderstandings happen. This is why people cry wolf when there are no wolves. They can't compute genuine benevolence, so they interpret it as hidden malice.

## You Don't Chase People, You Charge

If you want to help people who don't seem to want to help themselves—who are suffering, who you have a solution for, but who won't believe you or think you're just trying to manipulate them—the solution is:

**You don't chase. You charge.**

Chasing people who don't want help is Rescuer energy. It doesn't work. They resist. They suspect you. The harder you try, the more they guard against it.

But if you charge—if you say "I have something valuable, and it costs something to receive it"—then the people who are ready will find you.

The ones who get fed up with their suffering. The ones who've tried things their way and it doesn't work. The ones who are actually wanting to see another perspective so they can get out of their pain. They start looking. And when you're charging, they'll believe you.

Because they can see what you're getting out of it. It's believable. It's receivable.

## The Paradox of Receiving

Many people can't receive something for free. They can't compute it.

If you try to give them something from nothing, they're like: "This human must be selfish somewhere. Where is their selfishness?"

The only way for them to trust what you're offering is to let yourself get something out of it. Charge money. Ask for something in return. Not because you need to, not even necessarily because you want to, but because pure selflessness is unbelievable to them. They can't receive or value a gift they don't trust.

This is another reason not to be a Rescuer. Rescuing looks "too good to be true"—and that makes people guard against it.

## Why This Matters for This Book

This explains a pattern that shows up constantly:

- Someone makes a mistake and tries to help the other person see their part
- The other person interprets this as manipulation, blame-shifting, or trying to avoid accountability
- When actually the first person has already taken responsibility—they're just trying to help

The suspicion of selflessness is the filter that distorts benevolent intent into perceived attack.
