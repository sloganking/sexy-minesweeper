## The Self-Check

Before interacting and playing with another person, ask yourself:

> **Would I be engaging in this level of play if I was being handed a live gun?**

## If the Answer Is No

Ask: **Why not?**

Examples:

- "I took sleeping medication and I'm tired"
- "I've been drinking"
- "My mood and mind are not in a space of integrity"
- "I'm emotionally activated"
- "I'm not thinking clearly"

## Then Ask

> **Does this reason ALSO apply to my current level of activity?**

### Severity Levels

| Activity                          | Severity |
| --------------------------------- | -------- |
| Holding a gun                     | HIGH     |
| Touching/intimacy at a play party | MEDIUM   |
| Conversation                      | LOW      |

### The Logic

If you wouldn't trust yourself with a gun because you're tired...

Should you trust yourself with medium-severity activities while tired?

**If the same reason applies, politely disengage.**

## Example

> "I'm on sleeping medication and tired, so I wouldn't let myself hold a gun. And thinking about it... I shouldn't be touching people and risking mistakes either."
>
> → Politely disengage.

## The Iron Giant

"You are who you choose to be."

Choosing to disengage when you're not in a good state IS choosing who you want to be.
