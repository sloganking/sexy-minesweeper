## Meaning and mistakes

When a boundry violation occures, do you assume the best or the worst about the person who made it? What meaning to you ascribe to mistakes? Do you know you have trauma that cause your interpretations lean a certain way?

## Popcorn mataphor

Raise your hand if you've ever burned popcorn in the microwave. Almost everyone has. When you burn popcorn in the microwave, is it because you wanted to burn popcorn? No, it's because you weren't thinking, and even though you've cooked the popcorn in the microwave a thousand times successfully due to being sleepy or careless or something in between, you had an accident out of unconsciousness. People do this all the time in every field. This happens in sacred sexuality temples and play parties as well. The only thing is, when it happens at play parties and temples, our culture has a lot of trauma and sensitivities around sexuality, and the mistake is often not seen so kindly. People may project and assume you were conciously malicious when you were not and treat and attack you as such. People may treat the severity of your mistake as high, even though, in reality, it was medium.

My position, if mistakes happen in the container, is for you to tell us, the facilitators,

## Drama Triangle

(list here)

## Definition of responsability

- What happened, how did my actions play a part in creating this outcome? What can I do in the future to create something else I want instead?

omni-responsible.
People can't take responsibility for the things they believe they have no control over, and so many times, instead of lecturing someone on morality if they're not taking responsibility for something, showing them their own power, showing them that they have the power to create a different outcome, even when they haven't thought they did thus far, is all that is needed to do to get someone to take responsibility for an outcome.

## On how to make it right after a mistake.

- Take responsability and ownership of what occured.
- If you're the primary agressor/mistake-maker then appologize with action, not just words.

In my classes, I'm teaching apologizing with action, which means making it right, not just saying I'm sorry and then leaving the other person hurt.

I don't know how to put this in a chart yet, but I want to go over limiting beliefs and primary questions like the one taught in Tony Robbins' Date with Destiny, basically showing people what like single sentence thing is running your life and tainting how you see everything in the world. Because whatever comes up, whatever mistake someone makes, you make it, they make it, you're going to view everything through your beliefs and filters which are not necessarily real.

Trauma. What that does in interactions. How to handle it responsibly when interacting with others.
You may not even know you have trauma. It may be just one of those subconscious filters you view the world through. A belief and narrative about the world and what happened to you.

## Power dynamics

"The person in a position of power has power over me" is often not true. Sometimes participants who play victim can have a lot more power over facilitators and staff and similar than the facilitators and staff have over that participant.

(belief to refine) The idea that power dynamics are one way are always a myth. Created by people not recognizing their own power. Thus, they don't take responsibility for it.

## Appropriate response.

If you cry victim hard enough, you become the perpetrator. Getting the balance right of responding to the severity level of an incident and doing so appropriately is paramount to creating something good in the world and not doing something wrong and becoming a source of harm yourself.

## Making it right

When a mistake occurs, rather than blaming someone and attacking them and trying to go for an eye for an eye. If the person who made a mistake is If it was an accident, in our types of mistakes, or something else, and they want to make up for it, then what should really occur is allowing them to make it right.

When you're making it right, and you're taking actions instead of just apologizing with words, the person receiving you're making it right may want some things and not others. They may just not want communication at all, and at that point, respecting their wishes and not communicating is taking the actions to make it right. Even though it might not feel satisfying, because you might have wanted to give more than that.

## We usually create 100% of the outcome.

It takes two to dance, and when something you don't want occurs when you were interacting with another person, There are multiple people who played a part in creating that outcome. However, it takes two to dance, and the majority of the time, even though there were multiple people who took part in creating the outcome, you have the power to influence 100% of the outcome. If somebody invites you to dance, you both have to say yes in order for the dance to happen. If either of you say no, the dance doesn't happen. That's what 100% control of the outcome means. In recognizing this, you see that you don't have just part of the power. Oftentimes, you have all the power to create the reality that you want. This does not abdicate other participants from responsibility. Everyone, via action or inaction, created what happened. It's just a way of recognizing your own power. Showing you how in the future you can create what you want. Even in the face of actors who have other goals and may want different things. It's showing you how you can create your own safety.
