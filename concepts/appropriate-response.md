# Appropriate Response

## The Principle

> **If you cry victim hard enough, you become the perpetrator.**

Getting the balance right—responding to the [severity](./severity.md) level of an incident appropriately—is paramount to creating something good in the world and not becoming a source of harm yourself.

## Response vs Severity

```
Severity:    LOW ──────── MEDIUM ──────── HIGH

Response:    LOW ──────── MEDIUM ──────── HIGH

✓ APPROPRIATE: Response matches severity
✗ UNDER-RESPONSE: Enables continued harm
✗ OVER-RESPONSE: Creates new harm, new victims
```

## Unqualified Response = Over-Response

There's another way to fail this test: **responding when you don't actually know what happened.**

See: [Before You Judge](./before-you-judge.md)

If you're not a [qualified source](./before-you-judge.md#are-you-a-qualified-source)—if you haven't verified with primary sources, if you're going on vibes or gossip—then **any disciplinary action you take is automatically an over-response.**

Why? Because you don't know what you're responding to.

- You might be punishing someone for something that didn't happen
- You might be treating LOW severity as HIGH because someone was loud about it
- You might be responding to a distorted version of events
- You might be creating harm based on fiction

```
If UNQUALIFIED:
  → Any response > NONE is over-response
  → You are now a source of harm
```

The severity chart assumes you know what happened. If you don't, you can't use it yet. **Get qualified first.**

## Common Inappropriate Responses

| Response                     | What It Looks Like                     |
| ---------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| **Scorched Earth**           | Treating accidents like malice         |
| **Public Shaming**           | Using community power to punish        |
| **Weaponized Vulnerability** | Using victim status offensively        |
| **Silence/Avoidance**        | Never addressing it, letting it fester |
| **Triangulation**            | Recruiting others to take sides        |
| **Eye for an Eye**           | Trying to hurt them back equally       |
| **Mob Judgment**             | Group condemns without verification    |

## How Trauma Distorts Response

See: [Trauma & Filters](./trauma-and-filters.md)

When you have unprocessed trauma:

- LOW severity feels like HIGH
- Accidents feel like malice
- Your response escalates beyond what's warranted
- You become a source of harm while feeling like a victim

## Before Responding

See: [Response Flowchart](../charts/response-flowchart.md) | [Before You Judge](./before-you-judge.md)

1. **Pause. Breathe.**
2. **Have I talked to the people involved and verified?** (See: [Before You Judge](./before-you-judge.md)) If NO → STOP.
3. What is the actual [severity](./severity.md)?
4. What is the actual [type](./types-of-mistakes.md)?
5. Is my response proportional?
6. Am I reacting to NOW or to my past?
