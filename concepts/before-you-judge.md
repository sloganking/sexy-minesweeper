# Before You Judge

## The Problem

When something happens in a community, people form opinions fast.

They see someone angry. They see someone apologizing. They assume the angry person must be justified and the apologizing person must be guilty.

**This is not evidence. This is vibes.**

## The Witch Hunt Dynamic

Here's what often happens:

1. Person A wrongs Person B (or B _believes_ they were wronged)
2. Person B gets very angry, treats it as [high severity](./severity.md)
3. Person A [fawns](./fawning.md), apologizes, appeases
4. Bystanders see: angry person + apologizing person
5. Bystanders assume: "They must have done something bad"
6. A witch hunt begins based on **zero actual information**

The bystanders never asked what happened. They never heard from primary sources. They just read the room and picked a side.

## Are You a Qualified Source?

Before you judge someone, before you assess [severity](./severity.md), before you take any action—ask yourself:

> **Do I actually know what happened?**

### The Checklist

| Question                                       | If No...                         |
| ---------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Did I witness it myself?                       | Your opinion is based on hearsay |
| Have I talked to the people directly involved? | You're missing primary sources   |
| Have I heard from _all_ sides?                 | You only have part of the story  |
| Is my source biased? (angry, hurt, has stakes) | Their account may be distorted   |
| Was my source even there?                      | They're passing on gossip        |

**If you answered "no" to these, your opinion is unqualified.**

You don't know what to believe yet. And that's okay—it's honest.

## Primary Sources Matter

A **primary source** is someone who was directly involved in or witnessed the incident.

A **secondary source** is someone who heard about it from someone else.

If your only information comes from secondary sources:

- You don't know if they did their due diligence
- You don't know what was lost in translation
- You don't know what was added or distorted
- You're trusting human telephone

**Human nature is to assume things without evidence.** Don't trust that others verified before forming their opinion.

## The Fawning Trap

When someone [fawns](./fawning.md) after being accused or confronted:

- They apologize reflexively
- They try to de-escalate
- They look guilty even when they're not

Bystanders read this as confirmation: "See, they're apologizing, they must have done it."

**Apology is not admission of guilt.** It may be a trauma response.

### The Hidden Disagreement

Here's what bystanders don't see: the person fawning may **completely disagree** that they deserve what's happening.

If the accuser feels like a genuine threat—someone who could hurt their reputation, rally others against them, or escalate further—the fawner's survival instinct kicks in. They appease. They don't stand up for themselves. They just try to get through the moment alive.

Internally, they may be thinking:

- "This is bullshit, but I'm scared"
- "They're overreacting, but they're too angry to hear me"
- "If I push back, this gets worse"

So they apologize. Not because they agree. Because they're afraid.

**Apology under threat is not agreement. It's survival.**

## What To Do Instead

### If you're a bystander:

1. **Suspend judgment** until you have primary information
2. **Ask directly**: "Can you tell me what happened?"
3. **Hear all sides** before forming an opinion
4. **Consider bias**: Is this person angry? Hurt? Do they have stakes?
5. **Recognize your limits**: "I don't know enough to have an opinion on this"

### If you're being judged unfairly:

1. Recognize that bystanders are operating on incomplete information
2. Consider telling your side to primary witnesses who can vouch
3. Ask: "Do you actually know what happened, or are you going on what you've heard?"

### If you're a facilitator:

1. Don't let witch hunts form from vibes
2. Gather primary source accounts before taking action
3. Recognize when the "victim" may be [over-responding](./appropriate-response.md)
4. Protect people from mob judgment based on gossip

## The Standard

> **Before I judge, I need to know. Before I know, I need to verify. If I haven't verified, my opinion is unqualified.**

Not having an opinion is more honest than having an uninformed one.
