Not all mistakes are the same. Understanding the TYPE helps determine the appropriate response.

## By Intent

| Type          | Description                  | Response                              |
| ------------- | ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| **Malicious** | Intentional harm             | Accountability, consequences          |
| **Accident**  | Unintentional, unconscious   | Education, awareness                  |
| **Fawning**   | Person said yes but meant no | Complex — see [Fawning](./fawning.md) |

## By Awareness

| Type                          | Description                                                                         |
| ----------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Conscious, wrong thinking** | They were thinking, but thinking wrong                                              |
| **Unconscious, not thinking** | Autopilot, sleepy, careless — the [Popcorn](../tools/popcorn-metaphor.md) situation |

## Additional Types

| Type                    | Description                                            |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Freezing**            | Person went silent/still, didn't communicate           |
| **Miscommunication**    | Both thought they understood, neither did              |
| **Assumption**          | Acting on what you _think_ someone wants               |
| **Boundary Drift**      | Gradual creep past lines without noticing              |
| **Negotiation Failure** | Agreement existed but wasn't specific enough           |
| **Aftercare Failure**   | Act was consensual, aftermath was neglected            |
| **Projection**          | Treating someone based on your past, not their present |
| **Delayed Realization** | Consented in the moment, realized later it wasn't okay |
