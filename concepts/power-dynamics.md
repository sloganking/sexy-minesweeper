# Power Dynamics

## The Myth

> "The person in a position of power has power over me"

This is often not true.

## The Reality

Sometimes participants who play victim can have **more power** over facilitators and staff than those facilitators have over them.

Examples:

- A participant can destroy a facilitator's reputation with an accusation
- A participant can mobilize community against staff
- A participant can use their "victim" status as a weapon

## The Belief to Refine

> The idea that power dynamics are one-way is always a myth.

This myth is created by people not recognizing their own power.

When you don't recognize your power:

- You don't take [responsibility](./responsibility.md) for it
- You may wield it unconsciously
- You may wield it destructively while believing yourself powerless

## Power Goes Both Ways

| Traditional View                       | Reality                               |
| -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Facilitator has power over participant | Participant can also harm facilitator |
| Authority figure is always "up"        | Authority figures can be vulnerable   |
| Victim has no power                    | Victim status can be weaponized       |

This doesn't mean victims aren't real or that power imbalances don't exist.

It means: **Everyone has more power than they think.**
